# Install

First you will need to [install OpenMC](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html)

OpenMC_plot can then be install directly from the Python package index (PyPi) using pip.

```
pip install openmc_plot
```

# Usage

In the terminal type ...

```
openmc_plot
```

Your default web browser should then load with the GUI.

You will also need to have [OpenMC installed](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html).

# Run web app locally (developers)

To host your own local version of [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com) you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and then can build and run the Dockerfile
with the following commands.

First clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fusion-energy/openmc_plot
```

Then navigate into the repository folder
```bash
cd openmc_plot
```

Then build the docker image
```bash
docker build -t openmc_plot .
```

Then run the docker image
```bash
docker run --network host -t openmc_plot
```

The URL of your locally hosted version should appear in the terminal, copy and paste this URL into a web browser address bar.

# Maintenance (developers)

Pushing to the main branch of this repository triggers an automatic rebuild and
deployment of the new code using Google Cloud build at [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com)
