# Mysql random data generation

This is an auxiliary package for learning Mysql, and the I feel that inserting some test data is too cumbersome to enter manually, so I write a method that generates this data **randomly** and can **automatically** write it in Mysql language and save it to a text file. Currently, only insert into generation is supported.

0.0.5 版本支持多个分数，例如：("姓名", "性别", "年龄", "分数1", "分数2", "分数3")
Only Chinese is supported.
