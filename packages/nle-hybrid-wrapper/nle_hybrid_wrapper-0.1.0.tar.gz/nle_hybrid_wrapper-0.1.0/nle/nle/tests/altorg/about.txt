# Altorg Test Directory

This is a directory to mimic the real directory structure of the alt.org dataset, 
purely to test the process of adding the directory to the dataset 
(see nle/tests/test_populate_db.py)

Ttyrecs are replaced with (almost) empty files to save on space in git. 
We add multiple differnt xlogfiles (as is common for NetHack v3.4.3 and v3.6+)
one with multiple games in it.  

In the v3.4.3 case (xlogfile.txt) we remove some games from the xlogfile, to 
test whether the dataset will ignore ttyrecs that are either starting too 
early to be part of the game, or starting too late.

Finally we add one name to the `blacklist.txt` which should be excluded.
This is done, because some ttyrec files have encoding problems, and should be 
skipped. 

NB: Do not try to "run" this dataset - the ttyrecs aren't real.
