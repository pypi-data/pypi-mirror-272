Cross platform library to play sound files in Python.

## Installation

Install via pip:

```
pip install playsound3
```

## Quick Start

Once installed, you can use the playsound function to play sound files:

```python
from playsound3 import playsound

playsound("/path/to/sound/file.mp3")

# or use directly on URLs
playsound("http://url/to/sound/file.mp3")
```

## Documentation

The playsound module contains only one thing - the function (also named) playsound:

```python
def playsound(sound, block: bool = True) -> None:
    """Play a sound file using an audio backend availabile in your system.

    Args:
        sound: Path or URL to the sound file. Can be a string or pathlib.Path.
        block: If True, the function will block execution until the sound finishes playing.
               If False, sound will play in a background thread.
    """
    ...
```

It requires one argument - the path to the file with the sound you'd like to play.
This should be a local file or a URL.
There's an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default.
Setting it to False makes the function run asynchronously.

## Supported systems

* Linux, using GStreamer (built-in on Linux distributions)
* Windows, using winmm.dll (built-in on Windows)
* OS X, using afplay utility (built-in on OS X)
