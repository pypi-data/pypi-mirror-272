# MikroTik BT5 tag scanner for Python

This is simple library for scanning MikroTik [TG-BT5-IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/tg_bt5_in) and [TG-BT5-OUT](https://mikrotik.com/product/tg_bt5_out) advertisement packets.

See examples for basic usage.

## This is not recommended way for scanning important advertisements. There is high chance to miss packets that are caused by triggers.
You will have better results with ESP32: [MikroTik-BT5-ESP32](https://github.com/Anrijs/MikroTik-BT5-ESP32)
