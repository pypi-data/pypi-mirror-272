    A constraint on data to be retrieved from a virtual data lake.

    A given can be an item, a boolean, an int, a float, a string, 
    a bytes object or a bytearray object. If it is an item, it can
    be an `Itm` object or a `NamedItm` object. If it is not an item,
    it is a python quantity of the appropriate type. 
    
    An unknown is a vdl Unknown object.
    
    If a subject or a verb is given, then it must be an `Itm` object
    or a `NamedItm` object, because the subjects and verbs of triples
    are items.  If an object of a constraint is given, it can be an
    `Itm` object, a `NamedItm` object, a boolean, an int, a float,
    a string, a bytes object or a bytearray object. If a subject,
    verb or object is unknown, then it is an `Unknown` object.
    
    The data retrieved from a virtual data lake using a list of constraints
    consists of a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a
    solution that satisfies the constraints. The dictionary maps the 
    unknowns to the values assigned to them in the solution. The list

def __get_assigned_values__(assignments_dict, parts):

    Get the assigned values from an assignments dictionary in

    The content is returned in multipart form data format. One of
    the parts is named 'json' and contains one or more assignments 
    dictionaries. The assignments dictionaries assign python data
    values to the names. The python types of the python data values 
    depend on the virtual data lake types of the corresponding
    objects in the virtual data lake.
    
    A virtual data lake object can have one of these types: ITEM,
    BOOLEAN, INTEGRAL, REAL, TEXT, or BINARY. The corresponding
    python data types are `Itm`, bool, int, float, str, and bytes
    (or bytearray).
    
    Each entry of the assigments dictionaries is a name-value pair,
    where the value is another dictionary, which has two items: 
    'type' and 'value'. The 'type' is ITEM, BOOLEAN, INTEGRAL, REAL, 
    TEXT, or BINARY.
    
    If the type is ITEM, the value is a str that is an item identifier,
    and the assigned python data value is an `Itm` object whose itemid
    is that identifier. If the type is BOOLEAN, INTEGRAL, or REAL, 
    the value is a str representing a bool, int, or float, as appropriate,
    and the assigned python data value is the value represented by the str.
    If the type is TEXT, the value is a str and the assigned value is
    that str. If the type is BINARY, the value is a str that is the name 
    of a part of the multipart response whose content type is 
    application/octet-stream, and the assigned python value is its content.
