@dataclass
class CSIStorageCapacity(DictMixin):
    r"""CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given
      StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology
      segment.  This can be used when considering where to instantiate new
      PersistentVolumes.
      
      For example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234
      GiB" available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass
      "localssd" has "10 GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123"
      
      The following three cases all imply that no capacity is available for a
      certain combination: - no object exists with suitable topology and storage
      class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object
      exists, but the capacity is zero
      
      The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.
      
      They are consumed by the kube-scheduler if the CSIStorageCapacity beta feature
      gate is enabled there and a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware scheduling
      with CSIDriver.StorageCapacity.

      **parameters**

      * **storageClassName** ``str`` - The name of the StorageClass that the reported capacity applies to. It must
        meet the same requirements as the name of a StorageClass object (non-empty,
        DNS subdomain). If that object no longer exists, the CSIStorageCapacity object
        is obsolete and should be removed by its creator. This field is immutable.
      * **apiVersion** ``Optional[str]`` - APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
        Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
        may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
      * **capacity** ``Optional[resource.Quantity]`` - Capacity is the value reported by the CSI driver in its GetCapacityResponse
        for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that match the previous
        fields.
        The semantic is currently (CSI spec 1.2) defined as: The available capacity,
        in bytes, of the storage that can be used to provision volumes. If not set,
        that information is currently unavailable and treated like zero capacity.
      * **kind** ``Optional[str]`` - Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
        Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
      * **maximumVolumeSize** ``Optional[resource.Quantity]`` - MaximumVolumeSize is the value reported by the CSI driver in its
        GetCapacityResponse for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that
        match the previous fields.
        This is defined since CSI spec 1.4.0 as the largest size that may be used in a
        CreateVolumeRequest.capacity_range.required_bytes field to create a volume
        with the same parameters as those in GetCapacityRequest. The corresponding
        value in the Kubernetes API is ResourceRequirements.Requests in a volume
        claim.
      * **metadata** ``Optional[meta_v1.ObjectMeta]`` - Standard object's metadata. The name has no particular meaning. It must be be
        a DNS subdomain (dots allowed, 253 characters). To ensure that there are no
        conflicts with other CSI drivers on the cluster, the recommendation is to use
        csisc-<uuid>, a generated name, or a reverse-domain name which ends with the
        unique CSI driver name.
        Objects are namespaced.
        More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * **nodeTopology** ``Optional[meta_v1.LabelSelector]`` - NodeTopology defines which nodes have access to the storage for which capacity
        was reported. If not set, the storage is not accessible from any node in the
        cluster. If empty, the storage is accessible from all nodes. This field is
        immutable.
