class HTTPIngressPath(DictMixin):

      the path are forwarded to the backend.

      **parameters**

      * **backend** ``IngressBackend`` - Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be
        forwarded to.
      * **path** ``Optional[str]`` - Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this
        follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path
        of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from
        the conventional "path" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin
        with a '/'. If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic

      **parameters**

      * **host** ``Optional[str]`` - Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC
        3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined
        in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only
        apply to the
        	  IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.
        2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
        	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and
        	  :443 for https.
        Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the
        host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress

        allow the loadbalancer controller or defaulting logic to specify a global
        default.

        matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend.
      * **tls** ``Optional[List[IngressTLS]]`` - TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443.

        host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress, if left

        Field is left optional to allow SSL routing based on SNI hostname alone. If
        the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the "Host" header field used by an
