# VoiceOS Python SDK

This python client lets you build with [VoiceOS](https://voiceos.io)

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install voiceos
```

## Usage

Import the VoiceOS class from the package:

```python
from voiceos.client import VoiceOS
```

Create a new instance of the VoiceOS class by passing your API key:

```python
voiceos = VoiceOS("your-api-key")
```

Start using the python client to access the [agent](https://docs.voiceos.io/api-reference/agents/get), [calls](https://docs.voiceos.io/api-reference/conversations/get) and [phone numbers](https://docs.voiceos.io/api-reference/phone-numbers/get) resources.

```python
# Get all agents
agents = voiceos.agents.list_agents()
print(agents)

# Get all calls
calls = voiceos.conversations.list_conversations()
print(calls)

# Get all phone numbers
phone_numbers = voiceos.phone_numbers.list_phone_numbers()
print(phone_numbers)
```
