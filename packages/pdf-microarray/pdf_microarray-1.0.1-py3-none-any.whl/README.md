# PDFMicroarray

## Overview

PDFMicroarray is a Python CLI tool designed to assist with literature research for scientific papers and books.

It extracts text from multiples sources within PDF documents, including:

- Plain text
- Text from images (through OCR)
- Text from embedded diagrams (through page rendering and OCR)

and stores the extracted text in a designated output directory.

The processed text can then analyzed using the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to detect the occurrences of specified words. A graphical representation of these occurrences is offered in a microarray format.

## Installation

[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) is required for this CLI tool. Please follow the [installation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) instructions for your platform.

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx install pdf-microarray
```

## Usage

```bash
mkdir processed
pdf-microarray process -i documents -o processed
pdf-microarray analyze -i processed -w words.txt -o data.csv
pdf-microarray plot -i data.csv -o plot.png
```

The words in `words.txt` should be separated by newlines. If multiple words are on the same line, only the occurrence of all words is taken into account.

## Example

## Technical details

The library uses document segmentation and multithreading to speed up the extraction process, so that even large books in PDF form can be parsed within a few minutes.

The library utilized [PyMuPDF](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF) for OCR,  [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract) for PDF page rendering and [thefuzz](https://pypi.org/project/thefuzz) to calculate the Levenshtein distance.
