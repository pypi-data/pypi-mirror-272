    Implements methods from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10307).
    Its subclasses need to implement the `split` method.
    It should perform balanced splits separately for all classes.
    Its children are `IdentitySplit` and `TimeAwareSplit`.
    `IdentitySplit` has children `ClosedSetSplit`, `OpenSetSplit` and `DisjointSetSplit`.
    `TimeAwareSplit` has children `TimeProportionSplit` and `TimeCutoffSplit`.

    Attributes:
      df (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe of the data. It must contain columns
        `identity` for all splits and `date` for time-aware splits.
      seed (int): Initial seed for the random number generator LCG.
      n (int): Number of samples.
      n_class (int): Number of unique identities.
      y (np.ndarray): List of identities.
      y_counts (np.ndarray): List of sample counts for each unique identity.
      y_unique (np.ndarray): List of unique sorted identities.
