# Neural flow

This library implements a flow object and bijectors as FLAX modules. Conditional flows are supported.

This project was originally forked from [PZFlow](https://github.com/jfcrenshaw/pzflow) by [John Franklin Crenshaw](jfcrenshaw@gmail.com), but largely rewritten. PZFlow itself draws from other repositories, see the PZFlow documentation.

## Documentation

There is currently no online documentation, but the library has useful docstrings. Please use the docstrings and look into the usage examples in the `examples` folder.
