| `snews_pt` allows for fire-drill mode, currently this is the default option. <br/><br/> Later, it can be adjusted through `firedrill_mode=True/False` arguments in subcription and publication functions, and through `--firedrill/--no-firedrill` flags within the CLI tools. <br/>Make sure you have the correct [permissions](https://my.hop.scimma.org/hopauth/) to publish and subscribe to these firedrill channels. |
