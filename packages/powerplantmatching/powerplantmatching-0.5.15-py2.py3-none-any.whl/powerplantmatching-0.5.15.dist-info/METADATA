A toolset for cleaning, standardizing and combining multiple power
plant databases.

This package provides ready-to-use power plant data for the European power system.
Starting from openly available power plant datasets, the package cleans, standardizes
and merges the input data to create a new combined dataset, which includes all the important information.
The package allows to easily update the combined data as soon as new input datasets are released.

You can directly [download the current version of the data](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/PyPSA/powerplantmatching/blob/master/powerplants.csv) as a CSV file.

Initially, powerplantmatching was developed by the
[Renewable Energy Group](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/complex-renewable-energy-networks/)
at [FIAS](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/) and is now maintained by the [Digital Transformation in Energy Systems Group](https://tub-ensys.github.io/) at the Technical University of Berlin to build power plant data
inputs to [PyPSA](http://www.pypsa.org/)-based models for carrying
out simulations.

### Main Features

- clean and standardize power plant data sets
- aggregate power plant units which belong to the same plant
- compare and combine different data sets
- create lookups and give statistical insight to power plant goodness
- provide cleaned data from different sources
- choose between gross/net capacity
- provide an already merged data set of multiple different open data sources
- scale the power plant capacities in order to match country-specific statistics about total power plant capacities
- visualize the data
- export your powerplant data to a [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA)-based model

## Installation

 Using pip

```bash
pip install powerplantmatching
```

or conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge powerplantmatching
```
