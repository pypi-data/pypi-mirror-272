conway-polynomials-0.10 (2024-05-07)

  * Add polynomials for p in [65537,109987] and n=1,2,3 thanks to
    Sebastian Spindler.

conway-polynomials-0.9 (2024-01-12)

  * Support for pytest (just run "pytest").

  * The database is now xz compressed during the "build."


conway-polynomials-0.8 (2023-11-26)

  * Include LICENSE and COPYING in the distribution.

  * Fix an example in README.rst, and include README.rst in the
    example doctest command.

  * Add a few more test cases including a random property test.

  * Add type hints and clean up the documentation.


conway-polynomials-0.7 (2023-11-24)

  * Use tuples instead of lists for the coefficients.


conway-polynomials-0.6 (2023-11-23)

  * Happy Thanksgiving.

  * This is the first standalone python version of the package.

  * The source repository and issue tracker are now public.

  * The data are no longer pre-processed; we now read the coefficients
    directly from the upstream file. This is more transparent (easier
    to verify) and much easier to update if the source data ever
    changes.
