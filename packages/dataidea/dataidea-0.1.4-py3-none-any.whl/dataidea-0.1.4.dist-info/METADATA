# Welcome to DATAIDEA!


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Hello there ðŸ¤— and welcome to our new resourses site. We have
re-develped our website to use jupyter notebooks, which is the tool we
mostly use for teaching. This is so that you can access updated learning
materials faster.

## Programming For Data Science

Programming for Data Science is a subject weâ€™ve designed to explore the
various programming components of data science. To take on this course
means that youâ€™ll learn programming techniques to do Data Science stuff
like data manipulation, analysis, visualization, machine learning.

This subject has been split into specific courses as below. The duration
is the average of what our older students have taken, but can be longer
or shorter for different types of students:

- Fundamentals of Programming (Python or JavaScript or both)(1 month)
- Data Analysis with Python and Introduction to Machine Learning (2-3
  months)
- Deep Learning Specialization (3-5 months)
- Database Management with SQL and Python (optional) (1 month)
- Web Development with Django (optional) (2-6 months)

This subject can be taken as a whole or you can take specific parts of
strong interest or application to you and your field. But if youâ€™re a
complete beginner, we advise you take the whole subject.

Here is how our subject is offered:

- Duration: (Depends on the course units you have chosen)
- Sessions: Four times a week (one on one)
- Timing: Evenings or/and weekends
- Location: Online or/and at UMF House, Sir Apollo Kagwa Road

If youâ€™re serious about learning Programming and getting prepared for
Data Science and Web Development roles, I highly encourage you to enroll
in our programming courses.

Donâ€™t waste your time following disconnected, outdated tutorials. We can
teach you all that you need to kickstart your career.
