        # Prevent recursive propagation when logging in assess
        # We run the risk of recursively logging propagation events inside of log
        # statements. This is because the logging module sometimes uses streams to
        # output logs, and these logging events can inadvertently cause additional
        # log output that we use for debugging within our assess code. We want to
        # prevent this from occurring. Part of the reason for this is that we now
        # instrument stream reads and writes, but we also are aware that StringIO
        # is implemented with a lot of string building under the hood.
