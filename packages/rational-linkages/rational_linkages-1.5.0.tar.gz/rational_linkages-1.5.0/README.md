# Rational Linkages

Python-based package for synthesis and rapid-prototyping of rational linkages, 
developed by the Unit of Geometry and Surveying, University of Innsbruck, Austria. 
The **documentation with examples** is hosted on Read the Docs, available here: 
[Rational Linkages Documentation](https://rational-linkages.readthedocs.io/).

## Intallation instuctions

Recommended Python version is **3.11**, when it provides the smoothest plotting 
(but 3.10 or higher are supported). Python 3.11 is also the version used for 
development.

### Install from PyPI

Using pip:

<code>pip install rational-linkages</code>

### Install from source

1. Clone the repository (use preferably your client, or clone with the button on top of this page or using the following line)
    
    <code>git clone https://git.uibk.ac.at/geometrie-vermessung/rational-linkages.git </code>

2. Navigate to the repository folder

    <code>cd rational-linkages</code>

3. Install the *editable* version of the package using pip:

    <code>pip install -e .</code>

## Tutorials, issues, usage, and contributions

See the [documentation examples](https://rational-linkages.readthedocs.io/latest/general/overview.html) 
for tutorials and usage examples.

Since the self-hosted repository does not allow external users to create issues,
please, use the [external issue tracker](https://github.com/hucik14/rl-issues) 
hosted on GitHub for submitting **issues** and **feature requests**. Additionally,
you can *"watch/star"* the issue tracker package **to get notified about the updates**
(new releases will be also announced there).
