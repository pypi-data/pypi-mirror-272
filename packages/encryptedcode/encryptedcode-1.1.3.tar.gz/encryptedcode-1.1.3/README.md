<h1>Encrypted Code - L0123 Algorithm</h1>

> [!INFO]
EncryptedCode is a python library accessible to everyone that is under development where I use a new encryption algorithm created by &copy; Software Engineer <a href="https://leoglez.vercel.app/">Leandro Gonzalez Espinosa.</a> and named L0123.

> [!IMPORTANT]
pip install encryptedcode


### USAGE
This package is imported absolutely in your .py files, for example: 'from encryptedcode.encrypted_code import encode', and contains two functions, one for encoding called encode() and another for decoding called decode() using the new L0123 algorithm. A simple example of how to use the library is the following:
