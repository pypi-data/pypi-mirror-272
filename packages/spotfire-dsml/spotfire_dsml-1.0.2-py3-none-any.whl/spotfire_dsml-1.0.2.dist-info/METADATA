# Toolkit for data science and machine learning built by SpotfireÂ® 

This package provides several functions for Data Science Machine Learning (DSML) capabilities. While the functions can be used for any Python code they have been optimized for use in or alongside Spotfire. The functions include:
* Train pipeline-based supervised models
* Pipeline-based pre-processing and modeling for text data
* Preprocessing, smoothing and univariate forecasting for time series data
* Perform model explainability
* Calculate model drift
* Distribution fitting, normality testing, parameter estimation, distribution prediction, and probability prediction

### Installation
```sh
pip install spotfire-dsml
```
