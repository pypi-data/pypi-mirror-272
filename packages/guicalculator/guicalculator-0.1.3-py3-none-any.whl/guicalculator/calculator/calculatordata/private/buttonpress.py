    button_press - Handles simple button presses.

    Handles simple button presses that just add to the current formula. For
    example, a digit (passed as int, not str), ".", "+", "-", etc. Does not
    handle complex things like manipulating the value stored in memory.

    Notes
    -----
    As a side effect, will round the number currently being input to the
    precision in the Decimal context if symbol is not a digit or decimal
    point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symbol : str | int
        The digit or mathematical operator being processed.
