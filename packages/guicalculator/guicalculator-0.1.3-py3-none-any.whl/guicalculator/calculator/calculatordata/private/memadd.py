    memory_add - Add or subtract the current number being input to or from
    the value stored in memory.

    Notes
    -----
    If addto is passed in as false, will subtract the value being input
    from memory by multiplying the value by -1 before adding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    addto : bool, optional
        If true, performs addition. If false, performs subtraction.
