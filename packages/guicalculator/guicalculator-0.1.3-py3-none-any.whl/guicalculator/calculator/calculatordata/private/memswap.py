    memory_swap - Swap the value stored in memory with the current number

    Notes
    -----
    Cannot do a simple swap like (a,b) = (b,a) because we need to cal .set
    on the tk.StringVar that stores the memory value, and we round and
    format the display.

    As a side effect, will round the number currently being input to the
    precision in the Decimal context.
