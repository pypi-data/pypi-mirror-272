"""guicalculator/gui - This is the directory with all the tkinter widgets for the calculator

Notes
-----
The file listing here is hierarchical. Any parent file can directly reference descendants, 
but any descendant referencing a parent would create a circular import error. Instead, 
descendants reference parents by functions passed in as parameters.

    guicalculator.py - This is the root Tk window. It contains:

        calcstyle.py - The calculator ttk.Style object
