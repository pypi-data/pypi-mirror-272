    """
    numtostr - Convert number to string.

    Converts an int or float or Decimal to a string representation. Can
    add thousand separators and/or remove trailing zeroes after a decimal
    point.

    Notes
    -----
    As a side effect, will round the number currently being input to the
    precision in the Decimal context if removeZeroes is True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    val : int | float | Decimal | None
        Number to be converted. If None is passed in, None is returned.
    commas : bool, optional
        True means add thosands separators (commas). By default False.
    removeZeroes : bool, optional
        True means remove trailing zeroes after the decimal point.
        By default True.

    Returns
    -------
    str | None
        The string representation of the number, or None if None was passed in
