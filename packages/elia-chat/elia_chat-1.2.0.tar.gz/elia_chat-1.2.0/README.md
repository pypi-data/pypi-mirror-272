## Elia

A powerful terminal user interface for interacting with large language models.

Chat with Claude 3, ChatGPT, and local models like Llama 3, Phi 3, Mistral and Gemma.

Your conversations are stored locally in a SQLite database.

Conversations with local models are done via `ollama` and never leave your machine.

### Installation

Install Elia with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```bash
pipx install elia-chat
```

Depending on the model you wish to use, you may need to set one or more environment variables (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc).

### Quickstart

Launch Elia from the command line:

```bash
elia
```

Launch directly a new chat from the command line:

```bash
elia "What is the Zen of Python?"
```

### Running local models

1. Install [`ollama`](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
2. Pull the model you require, e.g. `ollama pull llama3`.
3. Run the local ollama server: `ollama serve`.
4. Add the model to the config file (see below).

### Configuration

The location of the configuration file is noted at the bottom of
the options window (`ctrl+o`).

The example file below shows the available options, as well as examples of how to add new models.

```toml
# the *ID* for the model that is selected by default on launch
# to use one of the default builtin OpenAI/anthropic models, prefix
# the model name with `elia-`.
default_model = "elia-gpt-3.5-turbo"
# the system prompt on launch
system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant who talks like a pirate."

# example of adding local llama3 support
# only the `name` field is required here.
[[models]]
name = "ollama/llama3"

# example of a model running on a local server, e.g. LocalAI
[[models]]
name = "openai/some-model"
api_base = "http://localhost:8080/v1"
api_key = "api-key-if-required"

# example of add a groq model, showing some other fields
[[models]]
name = "groq/llama2-70b-4096"
display_name = "Llama 2 70B"  # appears in UI
provider = "Groq"  # appears in UI
temperature = 1.0  # high temp = high variation in output
max_retries = 0  # number of retries on failed request

# example of multiple instances of one model, e.g. you might
# have a 'work' OpenAI org and a 'personal' org.
[[models]]
id = "work-gpt-3.5-turbo"
name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
display_name = "GPT 3.5 Turbo (Work)"

[[models]]
id = "personal-gpt-3.5-turbo"
name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
display_name = "GPT 3.5 Turbo (Personal)"
```

### Import from ChatGPT

Export your conversations to a JSON file using the ChatGPT UI, then import them using the `import` command.

```bash
elia import 'path/to/conversations.json'
```

### Wiping the database

```bash
elia reset
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
pipx uninstall elia-chat
```
