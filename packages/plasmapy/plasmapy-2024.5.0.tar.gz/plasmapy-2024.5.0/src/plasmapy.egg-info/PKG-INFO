[PlasmaPy] is an open source, community-developed [Python] package for
plasma research and education. PlasmaPy intends to be for plasma
science what [Astropy] is for astronomy — a collection of
functionality commonly needed by plasma scientists and researchers
globally, running within and leveraging the open source scientific
Python ecosystem. The goals of PlasmaPy are more thoroughly described
in [this video]. Current functionality is described in [PlasmaPy's
online documentation]. If you would like an idea of what PlasmaPy can
do, check out our [example gallery] of Jupyter notebooks. Many of our
recent presentations are available from the [PlasmaPy Community on
Zenodo].

Please [submit a feature request] in our [GitHub repository] if you
have an idea for new functionality. PlasmaPy is community-driven, and
feature requests really help guide the direction of software
development. Please also [submit a bug report] if you notice any
problems. We really appreciate it!

If you are interested in contributing, please check out our
[contributor guide] and [code of conduct]. There are also a number of
[good first issues] in our GitHub repository. New contributors are
very welcome!

[`src/plasmapy/`]: https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/tree/main/src/plasmapy
[`tests/`]: https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/tree/main/tests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PlasmaPy recently switched to an [src layout]. Source code that was in
> `plasmapy/` is now in [`src/plasmapy/`]. Tests are now located in a
> top-level [`tests/`] directory.
> Existing pull requests should pull in the changes from the `main`
> branch with `git pull upstream main` (assuming the remote for the
> primary PlasmaPy repo is named `upstream`).
> Because `git` does not automatically remove directories, the
> `plasmapy/` directory in older clones must be manually deleted.
> If you previously did an editable installation of PlasmaPy, it will
> likely need to be redone by running `pip install -e .[tests,docs]` in
> the top-level directory of the repository.

## Installation

PlasmaPy requires Python 3.10 or newer. If you do not have Python
installed already, here are the instructions to [download and install
Python].

To install PlasmaPy on macOS or Linux, open a terminal and run:
```Shell
python -m pip install plasmapy
```
On some systems, it might be necessary to specify the Python version
number, for example by using `python3` or `python3.12` instead of
`python`.

To install PlasmaPy on Windows, open a terminal and run
```Shell
py -3.12 -m pip install plasmapy
```
The `3.12` may be replaced by any version of Python that is supported by
PlasmaPy.

If you have [installed Conda], then you can also install PlasmaPy into
an activated Conda environment by running:
```Shell
conda install -c conda-forge plasmapy
```
PlasmaPy can also be installed using [Anaconda Navigator] so long as
`conda-forge` is added as a channel.

Check out our instructions on [installing PlasmaPy] for more details.

Please check out our documentation for more information on [how to
install PlasmaPy]. To contribute to the package or use the most recent
version, check out our instructions on [installing PlasmaPy from
source].

## Events

PlasmaPy has several [meetings] that are on our [calendar]. Events are
usually held on PlasmaPy's [Zoom] room.

Last-minute changes are usually announced on the [Matrix]/[Gitter]
chat room. The most up-to-date information about these meetings is on
the [meetings] page of PlasmaPy's website.

### Office hours

Our weekly informal [office hours] are an opportunity to chat with
active members of the PlasmaPy community about topics related to
Python and plasma science. If you'd like to learn more about PlasmaPy,
our office hours are one of the best places to start. As of February
2024, our office hours are on most Thursdays at 3 pm Eastern. Please
feel free to come by!

### Community meetings

PlasmaPy's weekly [community meetings] are a place to talk about code
development. If you have an idea for a new feature or would like to
make a code contribution, community meetings are a good place to go
to.  As of February 2024, our community meetings are on most Tuesdays
at 2 pm Eastern.

### Project meetings

PlasmaPy's weekly project meetings are a place to discuss education,
outreach, and project coordination. Topics might range from creating
educational notebooks to organizing community events. As of February
2024, project meetings are held on most Wednesdays at 3 pm Eastern.

### Working group meetings

PlasmaPy has started several working groups, including on diagnostics,
dispersion relations, and simulation. These working groups usually
meet fortnightly, and their meeting times can be found in PlasmaPy's
event [calendar]. If you would like to join a PlasmaPy working group
or even start a new one, please email us at [team@plasmapy.org]!

### Plasma Hack Week

A [hack week] is a mix of a hackathon and a summer school. Hack weeks
provide an opportunity to learn from each other and code together.
[Plasma Hack Week] was held virtually in the summers of 2021 and 2022,
and we hope to hold this again in the future. If you would like to
help organize a future Plasma Hack Week, please email
[team@plasmapy.org].

## Community

### Matrix chat

If you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is to
ask on our [Matrix]/[Gitter] channel. Both of these are the same chat
channel; Gitter uses a bridge to link the two.

### GitHub discussions

We're trying out [GitHub discussions] as a place to suggest ideas,
bring up discussion topics, and ask questions.

### Mailing list

You can subscribe to PlasmaPy's low-volume [mailing list] to receive
PlasmaPy newsletters and other announcements.

### Suggestion box

We have a [suggestion box] if you would like to (optionally
anonymously) suggest a feature/topic for consideration. These
suggestions might be changed into GitHub issues for further
discussion.

## Contact information

Please feel free to reach out to us at [team@plasmapy.org] or stop by
our [office hours] with any ideas, questions, and/or puns about
computational magnetohydrodynamics.

## License

PlasmaPy is permissively licensed under a [3-clause BSD license] with
added [protections against software patents].

## Citing PlasmaPy

An [emerging best practice for software citation] is to cite the
_specific version_ of each software package used in a research project
(instead of only citing a journal article, website, or GitHub
repository). The citation should include a persistent identifier that
uniquely identifies which version of the software was used. We
therefore ask that you cite the specific version of PlasmaPy used in
your research project. Releases of PlasmaPy are available from the
[PlasmaPy community on Zenodo], along with many other PlasmaPy
resources. Please check our documentation for more detailed [citation
instructions].

## Acknowledgments

Early development on PlasmaPy was supported in part by the U.S.
[Department of Energy], the [Smithsonian Institution], [NASA], and
[Google Summer of Code]. Ongoing PlasmaPy development is being
supported through a [collaborative award] from the
[Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation] program of
the U.S. [National Science Foundation].
