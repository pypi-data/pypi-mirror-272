OmicVerse is the fundamental package for multi omics included bulk and single cell analysis with Python. For more information, please read our paper: [OmicVerse: A single pipeline for exploring the entire transcriptome universe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.06.543913v2)

## Introduction

The original name of the omicverse was [Pyomic](https://pypi.org/project/Pyomic/), but we wanted to address a whole universe of transcriptomics, so we changed the name to OmicVerse, it aimed to solve all task in RNA-seq.

BulkTrajBlend algorithm in OmicVerse that combines Beta-Variational AutoEncoder for deconvolution and graph neural networks for overlapping community discovery to effectively interpolate and restore the continuity of “interrupted” cells in the original scRNA-seq data.

## Where to get it

OmicVerse can be installed via conda or pypi and you need to install `pytorch` at first. Please refer to the [installation tutorial](https://omicverse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Installation_guild/) for more detailed installation steps and adaptations for different platforms (`Windows`, `Linux` or `Mac OS`).

You can use `conda install omicverse -c conda-forge` or `pip install -U omicverse` for installation.

## Usage

Please checkout the documentations and tutorials at [omicverse.readthedocs.io](https://omicverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
