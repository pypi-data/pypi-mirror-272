DISMaL: Demographic Inference under the Structured Coalescent using Maximum Likelihood
======================================================================================

``DISMaL`` is a Python package for inferring historical demographies
(specifically, population sizes, gene flow, and split times) from
sequence data. It is an implementation of the *Generalised
isolation-with-migration* (GIM) model of Costa & Wilkinson-Herbots
(2021). Please cite their paper if you use ``DISMaL`` in published work:

*Rui J. Costa, Hilde M. Wilkinson-Herbots (2021). Inference of gene flow
in the process of speciation: Efficient maximum-likelihood
implementation of a generalised isolation-with-migration model.
Theoretical Population Biology 140:1-15.
