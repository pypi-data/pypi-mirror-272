## üîß How To Use

First of all, install the package using:

```bash
pip install pygramcore
```

To take authenticated actions, initialize your Instagram account with your email/password and login:

```python
from pygramcore import Account

Account.login("youremail@email.com", "yourpassword123")
Account.save_cookies("path/to/file.pkl")
```

To initialize an account from cookies:

```python
Account.load_cookies("path/to/file.pkl")
```

This will allow you to post images, comment on other peoples posts, send DMs, etc...

```python
Account.post("path/to/image.png", "Your very interesting caption")
```

To search for a user simply:

```python
from pygramcore import User

user = User("username123_")
```

Here is an example of the usage of a user:

```python
# Get a list of Post() objects
posts = user.get_posts(limit=50)

# Like the first 10 posts in the user's feed
for post in posts[:10]:
  # Get URLs of the images in the post
  urls = post.get_images()

  # Like & comment the post
  post.comment("Nice post!")
  post.like()
```

## ‚ùì About the Project
This Python package was created as a fun project to enhance my proficiency in writing "professional" Python code, building packages, implementing semantic versioning, and ensuring code maintainability.
I am still a relatively new developer, and I welcome any contributions and feedback to help me improve.
It is important to note that this project is not intended to replace essential packages such as [InstaPy](https://github.com/InstaPy/InstaPy), nor do I anticipate that it will.
