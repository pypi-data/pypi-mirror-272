# PyNorch
Recreating PyTorch from scratch (C/C++, CUDA and Python, with GPU support and automatic differentiation!)

# 1 - About
**PyNorch** is a deep learning framework constructed using C/C++, CUDA and Python. This is a personal project with educational purpose only! `Norch` means **NOT** PyTorch, and we have **NO** claims to rivaling the already established PyTorch. The main objective of **PyNorch** was to give a brief understanding of how a deep learning framework works internally. It implements the Tensor object, GPU support and an automatic differentiation system.
