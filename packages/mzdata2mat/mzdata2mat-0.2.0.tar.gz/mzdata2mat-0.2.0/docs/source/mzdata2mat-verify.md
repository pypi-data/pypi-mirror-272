# mzdata2mat-verify

## Presentation
This is a Command Line Tool (CLI) which tries to convert an example file in the current directory. It is automatically installed when you install the package.

## How to run it
It is really simple, to run it, open a terminal window in any folder you want and type the following command :
```shell
$ mzdata2mat-verify
```

If the package is correctly installed, you will see some lines being printed in the terminal. If it is the first time you are running it, some javascript dependencies will be installed on your system. When all of this is done, you will get this message :
```shell
$ mzdata2mat - Ready to use !
```

## If it fails
If you get an error message, it probably means that you don't have __node.js__ installed on your computer. You can get it for free at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you still have an error, open a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/MaximeLeMagicien/mzdata2mat/issues), we will be happy to answer you !
