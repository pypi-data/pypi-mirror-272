    A generic implementation of an evolutionary algorithm. It supports different individual candidates' representation formats and can thus be used to
    implement the traditional genetic algorithm as well as variants such as genetic programming. It requires specification of the selection and fitness
    function, of the population size as well as whether the algorithm should apply elitism (and with how many elite individuals) or not.
    The **kwargs argument is used to provide additional arguments for individual candidates' initialization.
    Note that the algorithm is designed to solve a maximization problem: if a minimization problem is to be solved instead, this must be taken care of in the
    fitness function.
