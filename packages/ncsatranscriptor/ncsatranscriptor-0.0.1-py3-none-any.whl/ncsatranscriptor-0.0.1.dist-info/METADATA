* Version 0.0.1
* Question - as written:
>    4. Write a program in any programming language to do the following:
        <br>a. Replace all the vowels in the string “National Center for Supercomputing Applications” by their corresponding order number in alphabetical sequence (a with 1, e with 5, etc).
        <br>b. Print the resulting string.
        <br>c. Print the total number of consonants in the given string.
* I have treated part C as, when referring to the "given" string, referring to this string: “National Center for Supercomputing Applications”
