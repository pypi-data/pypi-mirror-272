# A minimal Python package that plots slices of OpenMC regular mesh tallies with the model geometry.

Features

:straight_ruler: Axis units in in helpful units mm, cm, m, km

:eyes: Supports all 3 viewing basis (xy, xz, yz)

:hocho: Automaticly finds central slice or allows user specified slice index

:dart: Supports all values (mean, std_dev etc)

:black_square_button: Adds outlines for geometry cells or material at different pixel resolution

:arrow_right_hook: Customisable by passing keywords to underlying matplotlib functions colorbar, contour and imshow

:arrow_right_hook: supports further customisations throught ```matplotlib.rc()```

:heavy_plus_sign: Add tally results together to get combined plot.
