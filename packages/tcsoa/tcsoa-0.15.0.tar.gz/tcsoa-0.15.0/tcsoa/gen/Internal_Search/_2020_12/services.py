        Generates target data source compatible search recipe and parameters for a given list of Teamcenter
        ReportDefinition objects. The returned search recipes can be directly consumed by external data sources, like
        Solr, without additional help from Teamcenter. A ReportDefinition object holds platform independent search
        recipe. When this object is opened or executed from within Teamcenter applications, the recipe is first
        translated to work with the target data source and then necessary search actions are performed. This operation
        provides translated search parameters to the caller so that search actions associated with Reports can be done
        outside of Teamcenter.
        
        Use cases:
        Currently Teamcenter product data can be indexed in Apache Solr search engine as part of Active Workspace
        solution to facilitate full text search. The Active Workspace global search feature allows users to find and
        load Teamcenter objects indexed in Solr. To take further advantage of the indexed Teamcenter data in Solr, a
        microservice to generate charting information for a requested Teamcenter property has been introduced. The
        microservice expects a Solr compatible query to be sent as part of the request, along with the property for
        which charting information is desired. It then executes the query and sends back analytical information which
        the client can display as charts. Operation getTranslatedReportSearchRecipe provides the calling client
        information necessary to make a request to the microservice. 1.    Client calls the
        getTranslatedReportSearchRecipe operation to obtain Solr compatible translated search parameters for a group of
        ReportDefinition objects. 
        2.    Once the client obtains the necessary information, it makes asynchronous call to the microservice using
        the translated search parameters.
        3.    Microservice performs the necessary search action, puts together charting response for the requested
        ReportDefinition objects and sends it back to the client.
        4.    Client can then render the obtained data as charts.
        Note: Since the whole search and chart generation process does not involve Teamcenter, live update of the
        Report objects can be done asynchronously and without blocking the client from executing any other actions.
