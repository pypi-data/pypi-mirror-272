        """
        This is an internal operation which transfers ownership of objects that are in the input file. This is executed
        at the target site. Ownership is changed for more than one object. It is advisable to run this operation in dry
        run mode first and then perform actual ownership transfer. In dry run mode, actual ownership is not changed but
        validation is performed for the list of input objects.
        
        Output of this operation is a file which has status of ownership change. Format of the file in dry run mode
        with source extinct flag is as follows
        #Dry Run Report
        # TIE transfer data status (low level) 
        # Syslog FileName    :  C:\Temp\tcxml_xfer_ownership10302d08.syslog
        #$SourceSiteID: 100001
        #$TargetSiteID: 100002
        #$DryRun: Yes
        #$SourceExtinct: Yes

        #$owned by source site and not in consolidation list 
        QLK53SsdAABaBA    Item
        
        Following are the status codes and their interpretation
        0 : Success
        1: Failure [Island is inconsistent]
        2: Object is missing at target site
        3: New object at target site
        
        
        Use cases:
        If getObjectsForOwnershipTransfer operation succeeds, then this operation is invoked by the BPEL process of
        Global Services when user runs sitcons_xfer_owner_mgr utility of site consolidation.
