        """
        This operation returns the effectivity criteria associated with a set of RevisionRule objects. If a non zero
        value is specified for parameters 'substituteDependentVariables', 'applyConstraints', and/or 'applyDefaults',
        the operation will connect to the effectivity configurator specified by parameter 'configuratorURL'. The actual
        evaluation of configurator rules, and conversions to and from formula strings, are performed by this
        configurator service. The resulting formula string conversions may vary depending on the choice of service
        endpoint. For example a given configurator might return shorthand representations for formulae if these are
        unique in the context of the specified product. Teamcenter 9 only supports local builtin Teamcenter
        configurators where parameter 'configuratorURL' can be set to an empty string. Teamcenter configurators used in
        the EffectivityManagement service interface encode configuration formulae in Explicit Teamcenter Language for
        which no product context is required (see operation 'getEffectivityExpressions' for more details on Explicit
        Teamcenter Language and 'productName' and 'productNameSpace'.
        
        Operation 'getRevRuleEffectivityCriteria' should be used if symbolic variable substitution and/or constraint
        processing is required for *all* variant option families, or if validation records are required that specify
        violated constraints.
        
        
        Use cases:
        Use case 1:
        Initialize an effectivity criteria dialog for a given RevisionRule.
        - The application uses operation 'getRevRuleEffectivityCriteria' with 'revisionRules={myRevRule}, productName=,
        productNameSpace=', 'substituteDependentVariables=0, applyConstraints=0.'
        - The response will contain effectivity ranges as they are stored on RevisionRule 'myRevRule'  without
        additional configurator processing. References to effectivity configuration families (ConfigurationFamily) are
        returned in 'ServiceData'.
        
        
        
        Use case 2:
        Initialize an effectivity criteria dialog for a product that was created using the Teamcenter effectivity
        configurator with the intent to setup a new RevisionRule.
        - The application uses operation 'getRevRuleEffectivityCriteria' with 'productName=MyProductItemID,
        productNameSpace=MyProductRevID, substituteDependentVariables=0, applyConstraints=0.'
        - The response will contain all nominal effectivity ranges in this product. No constraint processing is
        required. References to effectivity configuration families (ConfigurationFamily) are returned in 'ServiceData'.
        
        
        
        Use case 3:
        Initialize an effectivity criteria dialog for a product that is associated with a Collaborative Design (CD)
        model with the intent to setup a new RevisionRule.

        The operation returns formulae for created/modified effectivity conditions in a configurator specific encoding

        whose service endpoint is specified by the 'configuratorURL' parameter. The actual conversion to and from

        If the effectivity condition are propagated to sub elements (e.g. sub ordinate elements associated with a
        DesignElement of category Reuse, or design features such as weld points associated with a Design Control
        Element), then these sub elements are returned as modified objects in the 'ServiceData'.
        
        
        Use cases:
        Use case 1:
        Assign an effectivity condition to a design feature (Cpd0DesignFeature) in a Collaborative Design model
        (Cpd0CollaborativeDesign).
        - Two alternative weld points exist in the context of a common Design Control Element (DCE).
        - Effectivity Unit=1..9 is assigned to the first weld point using operation 'setEffectivityConditions'.
        - Effectivity Unit=10..UP  is assigned to the second weld point using the same service operation.
        - Then effectivity Unit=5..15 is assigned to the DCE (Cpd0DesignControlElement), which reduces the effectivity
        range of all elements controlled by this DCE. The result is that the first weld point is effective for
        Unit=5..9, while the second is effective Unit=10..15.
        - Finally a NULL effectivity range is assigned to the DCE, which removes the effectivity condition from the
        DCE, and extends the effectivity range of all elements controlled by this DCE to their original values. The
        result is that the first weld point is again effective for Unit=1..9, while the second is effective Unit=10..UP.
        
        
        
        Use case 2:
        Assign an effectivity condition to a Design Element (DE) such that its effectivity range covers the combined
        range of effectivity of multiple other DEs in a Collaborative Design (CD) model.
        - Multiple alternative radar systems and radar screens exist in a CD (Cpd0CollaborativeDesign). Radar system R1
        is effective for Unit=1..10, while radar system R2 is effective for Unit=11..UP. Radar display unit D1 is
        effective for Unit=1..5, while radar display unit D2 is effective for Unit=6..UP. I.e. every product unit has
        exactly one radar system and one radar screen, but the combination of radar systems and screens varies for
        different product units.
        - The same radar cable C1 connects all radar units with their display screens. C1 is effective for Unit=1..UP.
        - Effective Unit=3..UP a new radar cable C2 shall replace C1 such that it covers the combined effectivity range
        for R1, R2, D1, and D2.
        - To achieve this goal, operation setEffectivityConditions is used to assign the combined effectivity range of
        R1, R2, D1, and D2, to the new radar cable C2 with affectedObjects={C2}, sampleObjects={R1, R2, D1, D2},
        opCode=11 (OR), and actionCode=1 (OVERWRITE). C2s effectivity range is now Unit=1..UP, while its effectivity
        configuration formula is Unit=1..10 or Unit=11..UP or Unit=1..5 or Unit=6..UP.
        - C2s design is completed and reviewed in this state.
        - Finally operation 'setEffectivityConditions' is used with affectedObjects={C2}, replacedObjects={C1},
        formulae={Unit>=3}, opCode=11 (OR), and actionCode=4 (REDUCE). C2s effectivity range is now Unit=3..UP, while
        C1s effectivity range is now Unit=1..2.
        
        
        
        Use case 3:
        Extend the effectivity range for a set of Design Elements (DE) such that their effectivity range also covers
        the combined effectivity configuration criteria attached to two RevisionRules.
        - Multiple alternative radar systems and radar screens exist in a CD (Cpd0CollaborativeDesign). Radar system R1
        is effective for Unit={1, 3}, while radar system R2 is effective for Unit={2, 4}. Radar display unit D1 is
        effective for Unit={1, 2}, while radar display unit D2 is effective for Unit={3, 4}. I.e. all product units
        1..4 have exactly one radar system and one radar screen, but the combination of radar systems and screens
        varies for different product units.
        - Field tests have shown that the combination between R1 and D2 is best. Therefore this combination shall be
        made effective for the upcoming new product units 5 and 6, represented by RevisionRules Rule1:Unit=5 and
        Rule2:Unit=6.
        - To achieve this goal, operation setEffectivityConditions is used to assign the combined effectivity
        configuration criteria associated to Rule1 and Rule2, to affectedObjects={R1,D2} by using sampleObjects={Rule1,
        Rule2 }, opCode=11 (OR), and actionCode=2 (EXTEND). The result is that R1s effectivity range is now Unit={1, 3,

        Parameter solveType can be used to specify a filter strategy when evalutating the effectivity configuration

        - MISMATCH                    1: objects conflicting with the solve criteria
        - EXPLICIT                        2: objects explicitly satisfying the solve criteria
        - COPRIME                        4: objects potentially satisfying the solve criteria
        - TRUE                            8: objects having an effectivity condition = TRUE

        more efficient if most objects are expected to fail the filter. On the other hand if most objects are expected
        to pass the filter than 529 is more efficient. If in doubt a value of 529 is recommended in most cases.

        are provided, then the available range of effectivity for these expressions and /or families will be returned.
        
        The operation forms a config expression from the provided input parameters by ORing the expressions in

        effectivity associated with the RevisionRule (using TRUE if none was specified). The response will return

        above) are provided. If all parameters are NULL the response will return no effectivity.
        
        Operation 'getRevRuleEffectivityCriteria' should be used if symbolic variable substitution and/or constraint
        processing is required for *all* variant option families, or if validation records are required that specify
        violated constraints.
        
        Operation 'setEffectivityConditions' should be used if assigning the combined effectivity range covering a set
        of existing objects does not require the evaluation of configurator constraints. The difference is that
        'getAvailableProductEffectivity' supports parameters that enable effectivity configurator validation rules,
        which can be used to eliminate effectivity combinations from the combined range that are not available
        according to the current set of validation rules. Eliminating invalid combinations reduces the number of false
        positive results detected by automated collision detection systems such as Teamcenter Clearance Analysis. On
        the other hand persisting such expressions causes the condition to be out of date if the set of configurator
        validation rules changes.
        This operation connects to the effectivity configurator service whose service endpoint is specified by the
        'configuratorURL' parameter. The actual evaluation of configurator rules to trim available effectivity, and
        conversions to and from formula strings, are performed by this configurator service. The resulting formula
        string conversions may vary depending on the choice of service endpoint. For example a given configurator might
        return shorthand representations for formulae if these are unique in the context of the specified product.
        Teamcenter 9 only supports local builtin Teamcenter configurators where parameter 'configuratorURL' can be set
        to an empty string. Teamcenter configurators used in the 'EffectivityManagement' service interface encode
        configuration formulae in Explicit Teamcenter Language for which no product context is required (see operation
        'getEffectivityExpressions' for more details on Explicit Teamcenter Language and 'productName' and
        'productNameSpace').
        
        Use cases:
        Use case 1:Initialize an effectivity criteria dialog for a given RevisionRule.
        - The application uses operation 'getAvailableProductEffectivity' with 'productName=, productNameSpace=,
        exprsToTest={}, and familiesToTest={}, substituteDependentVariables=0, applyConstraints=0.'
        - The response will contain effectivity ranges as they are stored on the RevisionRule without additional
        configurator processing. References to effectivity configuration families (ConfigurationFamily) are returned in
        'ServiceData'.
        
        
        
        Use case 2:
        Initialize an effectivity criteria dialog for a product that was created using the Teamcenter effectivity
        configurator with the intent to setup a new RevisionRule.
        - The application uses operation 'getAvailableProductEffectivity' with 'productName=MyProductItemID,
        productNameSpace=MyProductRevID, exprsToTest={}, and familiesToTest={}, substituteDependentVariables=0,
        applyConstraints=0.'
        - The response will contain all nominal effectivity ranges in this product. No constraint processing is
        required. References to effectivity configuration families (ConfigurationFamily) are returned in ServiceData.
        
        
        Use case 3:
        Initialize an effectivity criteria dialog for a product that is associated with a Collaborative Design (CD)
        model with the intent to setup a new RevisionRule.
        - Identifiers for the product associated with the CD (Cpd0CollaborativeDesign) are obtained from CD properties
        'mdl0config_product_name', and 'mdl0config_prod_namespace'.
        - The application uses operation 'getAvailableProductEffectivity' with 'productName=' and 'productNameSpace= '
        as obtained in the previous step,' exprsToTest={}, and familiesToTest={}, substituteDependentVariables=0,
        applyConstraints=0.'
        - The response will contain all nominal effectivity ranges in this product. No constraint processing is
        required. References to effectivity configuration families (ConfigurationFamily) are returned in 'ServiceData'.
        
        
        Use case 4:
        Iterate through all available configuration families (ConfigurationFamily) with the intent to assign values to
        each configuration family in an iterative process while dynamically requesting the remaining available range of
        values for a given configuration family.
        - The application uses operation 'getAvailableProductEffectivity' with the same values for 'productName', and
        'productNameSpace' that was used in the initialization step (see above use cases). Parameter exprsToTest is
        used to accumulate the choices that were made in previous iteration steps. Parameter
        'familiesToTest={nextFamilyInList} 'is used to specify the family for which available value ranges are
        requested in this iteration step. The remaining parameter values are 'substituteDependentVariables'=0, and
        'applyConstraints'=1.
        - The response will contain the available value range for the specified 'familiesToTest'.
        
        
        
        Use case 5:
        Request the effectivity configuration criteria in which at least one of multiple objects configures and
        eliminate criteria from this result that violate any current validation rules in the context of a Collaborative
        Design (CD) model.
        - A radar cable design shall be given an effectivity condition such that it configures whenever any of a given
        set of radar systems and radar screens configures.
        - Identifiers for the product associated with the CD (Cpd0CollaborativeDesign) are obtained from CD  properties
        'mdl0config_product_name', and 'mdl0config_prod_namespace'.
        - The application uses operation 'getEffectivityConditions' to obtain the set of conditions associated with the
        radar systems and screens.
        - The application uses operation 'getAvailableProductEffectivity' where parameter 'exprsToTest' is used to pass
        the effectivity conditions associated with the radar systems and screens. Parameter familiesToTest is left
        empty. The remaining parameter values are 'substituteDependentVariables'=0, and 'applyConstraints'=1.
        - The response will contain the actually available effectivity range for the listed radar systems and screens
        according to the current set of effectivity configurator validation rules.
