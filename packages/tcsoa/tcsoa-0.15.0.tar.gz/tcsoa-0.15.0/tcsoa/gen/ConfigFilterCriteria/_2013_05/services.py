        This operation returns a set of product configurations managed at the configurator level, say for product
        tracking or reporting purposes.
        Teamcenter variant configurators manage product configurations as VariantRules which are attached to an
        ItemRevision representing the product using any relationship type (see also preference
        'TC_Default_SVR_Relationship'). The product is identified by 'productName' and 'productNameSpace' parameters.
        Teamcenter configurators use a Multiple Field Key (MFK) stable identifier (see property'
        Item::fnd0VariantNamespace') of the product item for 'productName', and the revision ID for 'productNameSpace'.
        The identifiers of the product associated with a Collaborative Design (Cpd0CollaborativeDesign) can be obtained
        from properties 'Mdl0ApplicationModel::mdl0config_product_name', and
        'Mdl0ApplicationModel::mdl0config_prod_namespace'.
        
        Use cases:
        An engineering project administrator has created a product ItemRevision. A manufacturing engineering user
        creates and maintains VariantRules that represent a set of configurations for prototype builds. The project
        administrator attaches these VariantRules to the product ItemRevision. Product engineering users can use
        operation 'getProductConfigurations' to review existing prototype configurations. The user can then chose one
        of the configurations to initialize variant configuration criteria with operation 'setVariantCriteria'.

        """
        This operation returns a localized string representation for effectivity expressions. This string
        representation is the same that is used for display values of effectivity formula properties
        mdl0effectivity_formula and mdl0allowed_eff_formula. Applications can use this API to display effectivity
        conditions for objects that have not yet been saved with this effectivity, e.g. if multiple effectivity
        modifications are accumulated in a client session before they are saved. In this scenario effectivity
        properties are not (yet) available prior to saving modified objects.
        This operation connects to the effectivity configurator service whose service endpoint is specified by the
        'configuratorURL' parameter. The actual conversion to formula strings is performed by this configurator
        service. Depending on the (configurator specific) encoding the operation might require the specification of a
        product context using parameters 'productName' and 'productNameSpace'. For example, a given configurator might
        use  shorthand representations for formulae if these are unique in the context of the specified product.
        Teamcenter 10.1 only supports local built in Teamcenter configurators where parameter 'configuratorURL' can be
        set to an empty string. Teamcenter configurators don't require a product context if the formulae are in
        Explicit Teamcenter Language. The encoding is explicit if all lexemes are uniquely identified, e.g.
        [OptionNamespace]FamilyName = UniqueValue, where no product context is required to determine the family name
        for a value, or the option namespace for the family. A configuration condition formula is in Explicit
        Teamcenter Language if its form is explicit and comprised of the lexemes documented for the Teamcenter Variant
        Formula property. Teamcenter configurators support shorthand encodings like FamilyName = UniqueValue or
        UniqueValue if the lexemes used in the shorthand encoding are unique in the specified product context.
        
        Use cases:
        An application prepares several effectivity conditions with the intent to save them to a set of objects using
        operation setEffectivityConditions. The application wants to display the effectivity display string that would
        get saved with setEffectivityConditions before actually saving them.

        """
        This operation determines and returns the degree of overlap between a set of effectivity expressions and a set
        of reference effectivity criteria expressions. When applications create or update DesignElements (DE) and
        assign effectivity, the UI may want to qualify the degree of overlap between the effectivity of the DE and the
        currently active RevRule effectivity criteria.
        The following example illustrates the overlap states for a set of expressions:
        'RevisionRule:     |---------------|
        Object 0:  |----|                            : OverlapStateNone

        Object 2:                |----|              : OverlapStateSubset
        Object 3:                    |------|        : OverlapStateIntersect
        Object 4:  |-----------------------------|   : OverlapStateSuperset
        Object 5:         |---------------|          : OverlapStateMatch
        Object 6:         |-------------------|      : OverlapStateSuperset
        Object 7:     |-------------------|          : OverlapStateSuperset'
        This operation connects to the effectivity configurator service whose service endpoint is specified by the
        'configuratorURL' parameter. Any conversion from formula strings is performed by this configurator service.
        Depending on the (configurator specific) encoding the operation might require the specification of a product
        context using parameters 'productName' and 'productNameSpace'. For example, a given configurator might
        recognize shorthand representations for formulae if these are unique in the context of the specified product.
        Teamcenter 10.1 only supports local built in Teamcenter configurators where parameter 'configuratorURL' can be
        set to an empty string. Teamcenter configurators don't require a product context if the formulae are in
        Explicit Teamcenter Language. The encoding is explicit if all lexemes are uniquely identified, e.g.
        [OptionNamespace]FamilyName = UniqueValue, where no product context is required to determine the family name
        for a value, or the option namespace for the family. A configuration expression formula is in Explicit
        Teamcenter Language if its form is explicit and comprised of the lexemes documented for the Teamcenter Variant
        Formula property. Teamcenter configurators support shorthand encodings like FamilyName = UniqueValue or
        UniqueValue if the lexemes used in the shorthand encoding are unique in the specified product context.
        
        Use cases:
        An application wants to qualify effectivity conditions that were retrieved with getEffectivityConditions as to
        whether the condition is equal to, intersects with, or is a subset or superset of the effectivity criteria
        associated with one or more RevisionRules. This cannot be achieved with properties on effectivity conditions or
        RevisionRules because the result depends on the combination of an effectivity condition and the effectivity
        configuration criteria on a RevisionRule. One and the same condition may have different overlap states with
        different RevisionRules.
        The application calls getEffectivityOverlapStates and passes the effectivity criteria (as obtained from a
        RevisionRule using getRevRuleEffectivityCriteria) as 'referenceExpressions', and the effectivity conditions (as
        obtained from a set of product data elements using getEffectivityConditions) as 'expressions'.
