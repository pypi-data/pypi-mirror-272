class ConfigExpression(TcBaseObj):
    """
    Represents a configuration expression. The 'ConfigExpression' structure is interpreted as "'NULL'" when it has
    following values set for its parameters:
    'subExpressions' : An empty vector of 'ConfigExpression' structure
    'value' : A "NULL" 'ConfigOption' structure
    'opCode' : -1
    'formula' : A "NULL" 'ConfigFormula' structure
    'tnf' : An empty vector of 'ConfixExpression' structures.
    A 'ConfigExpression' that is equivalent to the Boolean constant 'TRUE' returns a TNF parameter comprising one
    expression with an 'opcode' value of '39'.
    A 'ConfigExpression' that is equivalent to the Boolean constant 'FALSE' returns a TNF parameter comprising one
    expression with an 'opcode' value of '40'.
    
    :var subExpressions: A vector of 'ConfigExpression'. If this parameter is present the enclosing expression
    represents a compound expression combining this set of subexpressions with the operator specified in the opCode
    parameter. If the enclosing expression is non-NULL either this parameter or the "'value'" parameter must be present.
    :var value: It is a 'ConfigOption' struct. If this parameter is present the enclosing expression represents an
    elemental expression literal. The parameter specifies the value to which 'opCode' compares. If the enclosing
    expression is non-NULL either this parameter or the 'subExpressions' parameter must be present. 'subExpressions'
    'and' value must not both be present.
    :var opCode: Operation code such as "and" and "or", see ps/ps_tokens.h.
    :var formula: It is a 'ConfigFormula' struct. If present, contains the configuration expression in string format
    (courtesy info).
    :var tnf: If present, this parameter provides a representation of the enclosing expression in Teamcenter Normal
    Form (TNF).
    The parameter is intended as "courtesy information" so to make additional SOA calls unnecessary by providing
    information that is expected to be of value if performance permits it. Based on the assumption that the vast
    majority of ConfigExpression structs can be converted to TNF very efficiently the server can afford to convert them
    to TNF as a "free gift". If this becomes a performance bottleneck the server may return a response with an empty
    tnf member, in which case the application can explicitly request a tnf representation using operation
    'convertVariantExpressions', if need be. Preference 'TC_tnf_timeout_period' controls the timeout mechanism. If TNF
    generation takes more time than specified in preference 'TC_tnf_timeout_period', server returns an empty 'tnf'
    member.
    If combined with OR the list of tnf expressions is logically equivalent to the enclosing expression. Each TNF is
    provided as a conjunction of Disjunctive Normal Forms (DNF) where all DNFs reference a single variant option
    family. Each clause in the outermost conjunction can reference a different variant option family.
    Example 1:
    Formula: (ENG = V6 | ENG = V8) & (D = 2.6L | D >= 3L & D <= 3.6L)
    TNF: Yes
    Note: DNF1 references family ENG and DNF2 references family D
    Example 2:
    Formula: (ENG = V6 | TRANS = AUTO) & (TRANS = M5 | ENG = V8)
    TNF: No
    Note: DNF1 references family ENG as well as TRANS and  DNF2 references family ENG as well as TRANS

class ConfigFormula(TcBaseObj):
    """
    Represents a formula string associated with a configuration expression in configurator syntax. 
    A formula of the form "[OptionNamespace]FamilyName = UniqueValue" is called "explicit" because no product context
    is required to determine the family name for the value, or the option namespace for the family name.
    OptionNamespace and FamilyName are explicitly spelled out. A variant formula is in "explicit Teamcenter language"
    if its form is explicit and comprised of the lexemes documented for the Variant Formula property.
    A formula of the form "UniqueValue" is called "stenographic" because a parser has to infer OptionNamespace and
    FamilyName. This is possible if there is only one value with that name throughout the entire product.
    If lexemes other than those documented for the Variant Formula property are used the formula is in "external
    variant language" and a custom configurator is required to decode the formula.
    If a formula is explicit Teamcenter language, productName and productNameSpace can be empty ("").
