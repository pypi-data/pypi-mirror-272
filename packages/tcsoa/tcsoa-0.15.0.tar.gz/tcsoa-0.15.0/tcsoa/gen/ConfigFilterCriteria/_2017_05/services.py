        This operation sets the effectivity expression on the input business objects. The subsetCriteria parameter
        provides the effectivity subset for which the new input expression should be combined with the existing
        effectivity on the target object. Additionally the actionCode parameter controls how this should be done. If
        the subsetCriteria parameter is not provided then the operation assumes the complete effectivity expression of
        the input object should be considered.
        
        Use cases:
        Use case 1: User adding effectivity on the object having no existing effectivity. User does not provide
        subsetCriteria. The actionCode provided is 1 (Overwrite).

        Use case 2: User adding Effectivity on object with existing effectivity expression. User does not provide
        subsetCriteria. The actionCode provided is 1 (Overwrite).

        subsetCriteria value. The actionCode provided is 1 (Overwrite).

        subsetCriteria value. The actionCode provided is 1 (Overwrite).
