    The AllocationContextInput2 structure represents all the data necessary for creating an Allocation Context. The

    :var name: The name of the AllocationMap object to be created. Optional input.
    :var type: The type of the AllocationMap object to be created. If type is not provided, the AllocationMap created
    will be of type AllocationMap.

    creation of type string/string. The client calling this operation is responsible for converting the different
    property types (int , float, date etc) to string  using the appropriate to XXXString functions. Multi valued
    properties are represented with a comma separated string.
