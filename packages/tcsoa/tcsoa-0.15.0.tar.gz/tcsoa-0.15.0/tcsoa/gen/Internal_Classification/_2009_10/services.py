        additional details from classification object as well. This operation only provides classification class
        hierarchy details.
        
        Exceptions:
        >The operation will only throw a 'ServiceException' for an unknown type of exception. In all other cases
        failures will be returned with the WorkspaceObject ID mapped to the error message in the 'ServiceData' list of

        Gets information about classification objects based on workspace objects. A classification object is also
        called an ICO. ICO property values along with the underlying class hierarchy information can be retrieved. The

        information on the underlying classification class structure for the classification object
