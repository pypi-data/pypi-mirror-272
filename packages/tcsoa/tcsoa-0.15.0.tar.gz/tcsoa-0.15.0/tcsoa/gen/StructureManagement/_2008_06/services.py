        This operation will validate the un-validated ItemIds that will be used to clone(duplicate) an assembly
        structure.  All portions of the structure that are displayed in the duplicate dialog have been validated by the
        client.  
        
        Note: The differences between the three operations 'validateStructureItemIds', 'validateStructureItemIds2' and
        'validateStructureItemIds3' are the following:
        - In 'validateStructureItemIds' the input is the top BOMLine of the original configured structure in Structure
        Manager.  In 'validateStructureItemIds2' the input is the selected BOMLine of the configured structure in
        Structure Manager or Systems Engineering.  i.e. the user can select to clone a sub-assembly of the original
        structure or the entire assembly.  The input for 'validateStructureItemIds2' includes project(s).  The cloned
        structure is assigned to those project(s).  'validateStructureItemIds' did not have projects as input.
        
        - 'validateStructureItemIds3' was created as a result of the Multi Field Key(MFK) project.  The difference
        between 'validateStructureItemIds2' and 'validateStructureItemIds3' is that in 'validateStructureItemIds2' the
        input and output have a 'DuplicateIdMap2' whereas to align with the MFK project, 'validateStructureItemIds3'
        has a 'DuplicateIdStructure'.
        
        
        Use cases:
        The user sends in a structure for validation of the new ItemIds .  The input to this operation is the top
        BOMLine, a map of old ItemIds to new ones for those Item objects that are already validated, and the default
        naming scheme.  Based on the structure traversal, the input map, and the naming scheme this operation validates
        whether the proposed names for the un-validated Item objects are valid.

        This operation will create a duplicate (clone) of the input structure from its top level down.
        Depending on the user action, all or some of the original structure is duplicated and the rest is referenced. 
        The user has the option to de-select a sub assembly or leaf Item on the duplicate dialog.  Those Item objects
        that are not selected in the duplicate dialog will not be cloned but referenced from the original structure.
        
        The user can define a specific naming pattern for the ItemIds of the duplicated (cloned) structure.  The user
        can define specific ItemIds for individually selected ItemRevision objects or a default naming pattern for the
        duplicated structure.   The default pattern can be defined by adding prefixes, suffixes or replacing part of
        the original name with a different pattern.  The user can also choose to allow the system to assign default ids.
        
        All of the structure dependent data of the input structure like datasets and attachments are copied to the
        duplicated structure based on the Business Modeler IDE deep copy rules for 'SaveAs'.  The duplicate operation
        internally uses 'SaveAs' at every level of the structure; therefore it uses the 'SaveAs' deep copy rules.
        
        CAD specific attachments and relations are copied based on the transfer mode defined for the Business Modeler
        IDE global constant StructureCloneTransferModes.  The transfer mode contains dependent closure rules for
        expansion and cloning.  The value for the closure rules is added by the installed CAD system.
        
        For e.g. The closure rule defined for IPEM ProE integration (ipemSCloneClosureRule) looks like this:
        
        TYPE.ProPrt:CLASS.ItemRevision:RELATIONP2S.IPEM_master_dependency:PROCESS:PartFamilyMaster:R,
        TYPE.ProAsm:CLASS.ItemRevision:RELATIONP2S.IPEM_master_dependency:PROCESS:PartFamilyMaster:R,

        Note: The difference between the three operations 'duplicate', 'duplicate2' and 'duplicate3' are the following:
        
        'duplicate' and 'duplicate2'
         - In 'duplicate' the input top BOMLine is the top BOMLine of the original configured structure in Structure
        Manager.  In 'duplicate2' the input top BOMLine is the selected BOMLine from the configured structure in
        Structure Manager or Systems Engineering.  i.e. the user can select to clone a sub-assembly of the original
        structure.
        
        - The input for 'duplicate2' includes project(s).  The cloned structure is assigned to those project(s). 
        'duplicate' does not have project(s) as input.
        
        'duplicate2' and 'duplicate3'
        - 'duplicate3' was created as a result of the Multi Field Key (MFK ) project.   The difference between
        'duplicate2' and 'duplicate3' is that in 'duplicate2' is that the input and output had a 'DuplicateIdMap2'
        whereas to align with the MFK project, 'duplicate3' has a 'DuplicateIdStructure'.
        
        
        Use cases:
        Use case1: Simple Clone
         A user has an assembly which does not have cad dependencies nor does it belong to a specific project(s).  The
        user wants to duplicate the entire structure with a specific naming pattern for the ItemIds.  The naming
        pattern is a prefix "test_".
        
        The user invokes the duplicate operation by passing in the top BOMLine of the structure to be cloned, and the
        naming pattern for the new structure.  The result is a new structure with the following naming pattern for the
        ItemIds -> test_OriginalItemId.
        
        Use case2: CAD Clone
        A user has an assembly structure which has cad dependencies.  The user wants to start a new product with a
        similar structure and cad dependencies.  The expansion and cloning rules have been defined in the Business
        Modeler IDE global constant StructureCloneTransferModes 
        The user invokes the duplicate operation by passing in the top BOMLine of the structure to be cloned.  
        The user picks the cad dependency option "'Part Families Masters'".  The expansion and cloning will be done
        based on the closure rules defined for Part Family Master in the CAD closure rules.
        The '"Rename Cad Files'" will be passed to the CAD integration in a callback.  If the '"Rename Cad Files'", is
        set to true by the user, the cad files need to be renamed by the cad integration.
        The result will be a duplicated structure with the expected cad dependencies and it will open in the CAD tool
        without any errors.

        """
        This operation is called as part of the duplicate functionality.   It expands the structure one level at a time
        and gets structure dependent data. The dependencies have been defined to allow duplication of CAD dependent
        structure.  The 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems' operation uses Business Modeler IDE global constant
        StructureCloneTransferModes to determine which of the cad specific attachments and relationships can be
        expanded. This constant defines the transfer modes containing dependent closure rules for expansion and
        cloning.  The value for the closure rules is added by the installed CAD system.
        
        Note: The difference between 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems', 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems2' and
        'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems3' are as follows:
        
        Difference in 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems' and 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems2'
        -    We allow the user to select a sub assembly for duplication.  There is a performance problem that was
        uncovered.  Even though a sub assembly is sent for duplication, traversal on the server side was happening from
        the top BOMLine of the structure.  To improve the performance we get a BOB object.
        
        -    The smart selection logic was added to decide whether to clone or reference an Item in a structure based
        on the project that the top line of the original structure belongs to.  This smart selection logic is bottom
        up, so if a child is selected based on project assignment, the parent will be selected, no matter whether the
        parent belongs to the top item project assignment or not.
        
        Difference in 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems2' and 'expandOrUpdateDuplicateItems3'
        The mandatory flag is passed back to the client.  When a cad option has been flagged with a mandatory flag, a
        "R" predicate in the closure rules, that option will come up in the Duplicate Dialog pre-checked and its
        selected status will be un-changeable.  This will prevent the user from un-checking those ItemRevision objects
        that were added in to make the structure cad consistent.  That is if a family table member in the assembly
        structure has been selected for duplication, then automatically include all its masters from the referenced
        ItemRevision all the way to the top master.  Including the masters automatically will only happen if the CAD
        closure rules are defined with a predicate "R" that says this CAD relation is mandatory for duplication.
        
        
        Use cases:
        The user sends in a structure for expansion, it will be expanded one level at a time and all dependent data
        will be returned based on the input and the value of the closure rules defined.  The input consists of the
        BOMLine for expansion, the ItemRevision objects on which to perform the expansion, and the dependency types. 
        The ItemRevision objects could be null, in which case the ItemRevision object(s) gotten from the expansion of
        the BOMLine are used.  The dependency types are checked against the definition in the closure rules to
        determine what dependent data is expanded.
