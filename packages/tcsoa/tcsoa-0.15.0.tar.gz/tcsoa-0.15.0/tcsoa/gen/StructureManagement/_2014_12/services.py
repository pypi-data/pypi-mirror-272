        This operation searches for delta changes in the structure based on different search criteria. The BOMLine
        objects directly or indirectly affected by changes done in Incremental Change context or revision effectivity
        context or occurrence effectivity context that are configured in are returned. The caller must supply the
        BOMLine object(s) that determines the scope for the search in addition to search parameters like intent,
        release status names, and one of unit range or date range. The lines returned are those that are configured by
        the current revision rule. All the BOMLines created/found will be returned as part of ServiceData along with
        incremental changes elements ( in case of IncrementalChange context), or ItemRevisions ( in case of Revision
        effectivity/Occurrence effectivity). All partial errors are grouped by the index of the input vector. This
        operation should be consided when the scope will not yield too many expandlines lines below.
        
        Use cases:
        A user wants to find a set of incremental changes of a particular type and with a specific unit effectivity.
