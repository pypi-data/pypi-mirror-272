        configuration. The ticket to the file(s) that contain the  product structure information is returned via this
        operation. 
        When this operation is invoked by the client to get the full product structure file, the response may contain a
        single complete product structure file or a single complete product structure file and a set of delta product
        structure files. In case a complete and a set of files containing delta changes are sent then the receiving
        client has to merge the delta files into the complete structure file.
        When this operation is invoked by the client to get the delta product structure, the response may contain a set
        of delta product structure files or a single complete product structure file and a set of delta product
        structure files.  In case where only a set of delta files are returned, the client need to merge those file
        with its available complete structure file. When a single complete product structure file and a set of delta
        product structure files are returned, then this means that the delta token identifier could not be identified
        on the server and hence a complete product structure information has been returned.
        The response also contains a delta identifier token. This delta identifier token has to be passed during the
        next call to  getStructureFiles operation in case the client needs the delta files since the previous call to

        response would contain a complete product structure file along with a set of delta product structure files that
        were generated since the complete product structure file was produced.
        4.    If the product structure information is returned as a complete file and a set of delta files then the

        the product structure information for different product and configurations. Now when the Visualization client
        sends a request to QDS asking information about a product and configuration, the QDS invokes this operation to
        determine the id of the structure which contain information about the requested product and configuration.
        
        Say for example the QDS may have a product structure information with id "UidOfBomIndexAdminData1" that
        contains product structure information of product1 for RevisionRule as "Latest Working" and VariantRule
        "vrule1", "vrule2", "vrule3" and a product structure information with id "UidOfBomIndexAdminData2" that
        contains product structure information of product2 for RevisionRule as "Latest Released" and VariantRule
        "vrule1", "vrule2", "vrule3" and. Now if the Visualization client wants to display the product1 for "Latest
        working" with "vrule2", it contacts the QDS server with this information. The QDS in turn  invokes this
        operation with the given information to determine the id of the mmp file, in this case it would return

        client for it to apply  massive model visualization algorithm.
