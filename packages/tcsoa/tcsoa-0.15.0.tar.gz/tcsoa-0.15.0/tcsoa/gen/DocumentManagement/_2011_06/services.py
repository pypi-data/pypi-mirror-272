        This operation processes the metadata exchange mapping information between the client application and
        Teamcenter from the provided input list of ResolveAttrMappingsAndGetPropertiesInfo structure (containing the
        metadata exchange mapping information from the client application).  The operation then gets and returns the
        property  values of the corresponding Teamcenter object from provided input information.
        
        Use cases:
        Metadata exchange between Teamcenter and Microsoft Office Word application
        From the Teamcenter client for Microsoft Office Word 2010, a user opens and checks out a WordX Dataset.  User
        then clicks on the Teamcenter ribbon and clicks on Attribute Exchange> Configurations> Create.  From here user
        can set up the metadata exchange between the properties of the Microsoft Office Word file properties and the
        properties of the Teamcenter object.  
        
        In the configuration, user can set the direction of the metadata exchange either as File to Teamcenter,
        Teamcenter to File, or Two Way.  In this case, user selects Teamcenter to File for the metadata exchange from
        the client to Teamcenter.  User sets up the property mapping by selecting a file property (Comments for
        example) and selecting a Teamcenter object property (object_desc for example), and saves the attribute exchange
        configuration.  User then clicks on Attribute Exchange>Reload button.  The Microsoft Office Word initiates this
        operation and gets Teamcenter object property (object_desc for example) value back.  To verify the client file
        property gets updated, from Microsoft Office Word menu File, select Info (in the left panel), then select
        Properties (in the right panel), then select Show Document Panel.
