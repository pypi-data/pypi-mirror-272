        or ItemRevision in the 'component' parameter and also specify the new variant condition in 'metaExpr'
        parameter. In this case, size of 'bomlinesToReplace' list should be 1.

        specifying variant condition data using 'metaExpr' parameter and the multiple designs Item Revisions in
        'prodRevs' parameter. The number of design solutions whose variant data is to be updates is represented by
