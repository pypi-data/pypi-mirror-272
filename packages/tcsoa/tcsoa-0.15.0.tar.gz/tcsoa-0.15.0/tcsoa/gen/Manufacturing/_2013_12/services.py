        This operation imports STEP 3D model files for Generic Tool Catalog (GTC) vendor catalog components. The STEP
        files are converted to NX part and to JT file format and imported into Teamcenter. If needed, items are created
        for the Classification objects (ICO). One UGMaster dataset for the NX part file and one DirectModel dataset for
        the JT file is created below the (new) item.
        
        Use cases:
        There are two different use cases:
            A) The specified ICO is classified in a GTC vendor catalog class
        (the ICO has an attribute -159003 "3D Model file name")
            B) The specified ICO is classified in an MRL MyComponents class
        (the ICO does not have an attribute -159003 "3D Model file name")
        
        In use case A, this operation retrieves the file name of the 3D model directly from GTC attribute 
        -159003 "3D Model file name".
        (Another attribute ID instead of -159003 can be defined in the "MRMGTC3DModelAttributeID" preference.)
        
        In use case B, the SOA operation checks if there is an Manufacturing Resource Libraray (MRL) attribute -40930
        "Vendor Reference Object ID" in the given ICO. This attribute is used to store the reference from the MRL
        MyComponents ICO to the GTC vendor catalog ICO. If this attribute exists in the ICO's class and has a valid ICO
        ID as value, the 3D model file name will be retrieved from the referenced ICO. (see use case A)
        (Another attribute ID instead of -40930 can be defined in the "MRMGTCReferenceObjectAttributeID"preference.)
        
        The SOA operation retrieves the information about the server-sided directory, where all STEP 3D models of the
        catalog are stored, based on the class of the GTC vendor catalog ICO.
        
        If there is a problem during importing one of the 3D models, the operation will continue importing the 3D
        models of the following ICOs.
        
        Note: The Graphics Builder has to be configured properly for this operation to work.
