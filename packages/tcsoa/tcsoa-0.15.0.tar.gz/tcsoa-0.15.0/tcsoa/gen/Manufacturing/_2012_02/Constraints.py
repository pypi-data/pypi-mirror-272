    A structure that contains information about an problem detected in the ValidateProcessAreaAssignments operation.
    In the case of a precedence constraint violation, the objectsOfContextOfConstraint vector will contain the
    predecessor and the sucessor operation or process whose order is conflicting with the order of the process areas
    they are assigned to, if a Product BOP is given. The objectsOfContextToValidate member will contain their
    respective counterparts in the Plant BOP, and processAreas will contain the associated process areas. In case of a
    precedence constraint violations the constraints vector will be empty, since the constraints themselves are
    meaningless without the intermittent operations/processes. In order to obtain the paths of processes/operations and
    constraints that define the precedence of the start and end node, the GetPrecedenceConstraintPathsAPI may be used.
    Currently one possible type of error may arise when precedence constraints are violated. The format of the error
    message is similar to the following:
    <Node A> is assigned to <Process Area X> while its successor <Node B> is assigned to <Process Area Y>  which is a
    predecessor of  <Process Area X>.

    :var objectsOfContextToValidate: The list of assigned nodes from the contextToValidate parameter. In case only a
