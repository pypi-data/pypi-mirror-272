        This operation imports discrete and continuous manufaturing features (MFGs) from a given PLMXML file into a

        of the MFGs. Their transform, their parts' connection, and their form attributes. There are two types of
        manufacturing features. Continuous MFG like arcweld ( Mfg0BVRArcWeld) and discrete MFGs like weld point
        (Mfg0BVRWeldPoint) and datum point (Mfg0BVRDatumPoint). For continuous MFGs, the PLMXML also contains the JT

        This service operation creates a Collaboration Planning Context (CPC) with the given input  structures that are
        to be cloned and/or referred to, and establishes a relation between input MECollaborationContext (CC) object
        and newly created CPC. 
        CPC is a CC object itself, it is a term used for mix production.
        
        Use cases:
        A user creates a CPC object in Manufacturing Process Planner (MPP) application using an existing opened CC
        structure. Subsequently a relation Mfg0MEAlternatePlanningRel is created between newly created CPC and the
        orginal CC.
        
        Use Case 1: The user opens a CC structure, select some structures available in the CC and creates a CPC.
        
        Use Case 2: A user opens a CC structure, select some of the scopes in that structure and create a CPC.
        
        Use Case 3: A user opens a CC structure, select some structures/scopes, provide whether they need to be
        referred or cloned and provide cloning parameters such as Clone Suppressed Lines, Carry Over ICs etc. to create
        a CPC.
