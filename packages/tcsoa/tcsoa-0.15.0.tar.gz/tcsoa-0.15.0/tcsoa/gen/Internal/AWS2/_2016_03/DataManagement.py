    is populated with the page that was processed. Typically the value of the processedPage would be the same as the
    targetPage, except when the targetPage value is empty or not found in the stylesheet. In that case, then the first
    page in the stylesheet is processed.
    :var datasetInfo: The information about the stylesheet.

    value is the FMS ticket of the image for that resolution type.When resolution is not specified in the stylesheet or
    is invalid, FMS ticket mentioned in the default key will be populated.If the styesheet being rendered is SUMMARY,
