    An example for this input:
    
    StringFilter - User wants to search all the tasks based on any string property on EPMtask like object_type etc.
    
    DateFilter - User wants to search all the tasks based on any date property on EPMTask like due_date etc.
    
    NumericFilter - User wants to search all the tasks based on any numeric property on EPMTask like task_duration etc.
    :var stringValue: The value for a string filter. This field is applicable only if the "searchFilterType" field is
    set to "StringFilter".
    :var startDateValue: The starting value for a date filter. This field is applicable only if the "searchFilterType"
