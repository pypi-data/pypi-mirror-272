    The awp0Params entry is parsed, and each name/value pair is added to a string map, where key is the parameter name,

    For example:  awp0Params may contain an entry such as "refresh=true;filter=POM_application_object.owning_user".  
    
    The resulting map would contain the following parsed pairs:
    
    "refresh":"true",
