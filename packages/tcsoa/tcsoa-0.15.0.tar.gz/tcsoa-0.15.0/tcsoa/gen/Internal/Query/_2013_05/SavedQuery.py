class SavedQueryClause2(TcBaseObj):
    """
    Holds the definition of a single saved query clause.  A query clause represents a single attribute that the end
    user can supply as search criteria.  Each saved query is made up of any number of ordered clauses.  Each attribute
    in this list is displayed to the end user allowing them to enter a search value.  Additional information includes
    LOV data for that attribute.  More common information includes the L10N key to be used when converting the
    attribute name for display to the user.  Also included is the logical operator to be used when evaluating this
    attribute in the saved query, and the comparison to be made between the user entered value and the value in the
    database.
    
    :var attributeName: Name of the attribute.
    :var entryL10NKey: The L10N key used when displaying this attribute to the user.
    :var keyLovId: Id of the key LOV for this attribute.
    :var attributeType: Type of attribute as defined in the AttributeDescriptor definition. Currently used to determine
    the correct attribute type to decide how the particular clause should be handled in the search form.  Also used in
    the LOV kernel component for deciding how the dependent clauses should be formatted.
    :var entryNameDisplay: The translated version of the L10N key that will be displayed to the user.
    :var logicalOperator: Logical operator to use when evaluating the clause.  This can be "AND", "OR" or "".
    :var mathOperator: Math operator to use when evaluating the clause.  This can be "=", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", "<=",
    "IS_NULL" or "IS_NOT_NULL".
    :var defaultInternalValue: Default internal value used for this attribute.
    :var defaultDisplayValue: Default display value used for this attribute.
    :var lov: LOV defined with this clause.
    :var attachedSpecifier: The attached specifier for the LOV.
    :var dependentIndexes: All the dependent indexes for this clause.

    Contains the clauses and sort attributes that make up a saved query definition.  Each of the search clauses and
    sort attributes in the definition are order dependent.  The order of the clause attributes indicates how the 'AND'
    and 'OR' logic of the saved query will be evaluated.  The order of the sort attributes indicates the precedence of
    the results sorting.
    
    :var query: Query definition on the server.
    :var clauses: The ordered set of clauses that make up the query definition.  Each clause represents an attribute

    :var sortAttributes: Optional list of attributes to be used for default sorting.  The ascending or descending order
    is included in the definition.  The order that the attributes appear in the vector indicate the order that they
    will impact the sorting.
