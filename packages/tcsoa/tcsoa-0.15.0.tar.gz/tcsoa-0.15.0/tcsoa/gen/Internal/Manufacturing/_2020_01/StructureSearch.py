    A search input consists of list of process line object from BOP structure on which the search is executed, the
    object type to be searched for, the query type of the search, the closure rule to traverse the BOP structure , a
    flag to return the object type which are assigned to the input process line object and a map containing the
    additional information (if required).
    
    :var processScopeForSearch: The list of process line object from BOP structure, which has defined scope from Bill
    of Material (BOM).
    :var objectType: The object type to be searched for. Valid types are: Mfg0BvrWeldPoint, Mfg0BvrArcWeld, Mfg0BvrPLP
    and Mfg0BvrPart.
    :var queryType: The query to search on the input process scope. The valid values are: "Unassigned",
    "ConsumedConnected" and "ConsumedConnectedUnassigned". The "Unassigned" query searches for the unassigned input
    object type in the process scope specified as input. The "ConsumedConnected" query first searches for the assigned
    input object type in the input process scope and then for output objects, it finds out the connected parts. The
    "ConsumedConnectedUnassigned" query first searches for the assigned input object type in the input process scope
    and then for output objects, it finds out the connected parts and filter out unassigned parts.
    :var closureRuleName: The name of the closure rule to be used to traverse the BOP structure.
    :var returnAssignedObjects: If true, the response also returns input object type which are assigned to the input
    process scope.
    :var additionalInfo: A structure containing the maps to capture the additional information.
    1. User can provide the additional scope for the query which is not defined by "Set Scope" operation. The key is
    "AdditionalScope" and the value is list of additional scope from the BOM structure.
    2. User need to search for the objects of specific type which are not part of the BOM scope. The key is
    "OutOfScopeObjects" and the value is the "Object Type".
