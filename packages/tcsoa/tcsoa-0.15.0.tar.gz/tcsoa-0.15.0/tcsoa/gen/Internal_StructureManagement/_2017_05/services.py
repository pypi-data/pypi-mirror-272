        This operation returns Fnd0BomLineLite as objects for input UIDs of Fnd0BomLineLite.

        outputPageSize specified in 'Controls'. The 'RelationAndTypesCriteria' of 'Controls' is used to retrieve
        Dataset, named references objects with FMS tickets when named reference object is file.
        
        Use cases:
        This operation helps while working with large structure. 
        
        1. Client creates BOMWindow with RevisionRule and sets top BOMLine.
        2. Client optionally sets Variant Rule on BOMWindow.

        Fnd0BomLineLite objects.

        5. Client invokes getUndelivered3 operation to get next set of undelivered Fnd0BomLineLites along with Dataset.

        information on client and Dataset to render the product.
