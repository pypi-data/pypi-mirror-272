        This operation will perform the specified result override approval life cycle actions for given

        Use cases:
        It is desirable that requests for override approval on failed checkers to be left to the design user
        discretion. The design user may have good justification to argue that a failed checker can be corrected at a
        later design stage. Therefore, the capability to approve a result override request on a failed checker by
        designated approvers in a company will be necessary to allow the part design to progress smoothly without
        passing an overridden failed checker.

        Use cases:

        validation application utility. After executing validation business logic on the part, the user will use this

        compliance status of the part.
