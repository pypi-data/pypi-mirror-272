    This structure holds information about the object(s) that will be launched to the viewer. It may contain addtional
    option information that can affect how the VVI is to be generated.
    
    :var launchedObject: The business object to be laucnhed. Launched object could be of type Item, ItemRevision,
    Dataset, BOMView, BOMViewRevision or Awb0ProductContextInfo. The business object will be resolved by the server in
    some cases (e.g. Item or ItemRevision launch) to a directly launchable visualization object (such as a DirectModel
    Dataset or BOMViewRevision).
    :var item: The parent or containing Item of the launched object.  If this is not provided, the server will attempt
    to identify the parent if it can. If the parent information cannot be identified, this will not result in an error
    condition. The parent Item information will simply not be passed to the visualization client, which could affect
    what features are available in the client.
    :var itemRev: The parent or containing ItemRevision of the launched object. If this is not known, the server will
    attempt to identify the parent if it can. If the parent information cannot be identified, this will not result in
    an error condition. The parent ItemRevision information will simply not be passed to the visualization client,
    which could affect what features are available in the client.
    :var occurrencesList: The list of selected occurrences being launched. These occurrences may be of type BOMLine or
    Awb0Element. When this vector is non-empty then the launchedObject field of the IdInfo structure must contain an
    object that defines the configuration state for the occurrences. For example, the configuration object is of type
    Awb0ProductContextInfo when the occurrences are of type Awb0Element. The configuration object is of type BOMWindow
    when the occurrences are of type BOMLine.
    :var createOptions: Map of option names to OptionInfo structures. These options are used to control the creation of
    the launch information in some way.
    
    Current options include:
    
    "CreateVisSC" - "True" or "False"
       Informs the service to create a VisStructureContext object based on the laucnhedObject and occurrenceList field
    of the IdInfo structure.
    
    "OVERRIDE_VisDoc_Type" - some replacement string
       Directs the service to replace the value of the VisDoc_Type key in the launch file with the specified string.
    
    "TransientDoc" - "True" or "False"
       Indicates whether the launched object is to be considered transient by the viewer. Transient objects are
    normally deleted when the viewer is finished with the document used to open the launched object.
    
    "Operation" - "open", "insert", "merge", "interop"
       Informs the viewer on what type of launch operation is being requested.
    
    "OperationStructure" - "Dynamic", "Static", "Preference", "Ask"
       Informs the viewer on what type of structure launch is being requested.
    
    "UseTransientVolume" - "True" or "False"
       Determines how the service is to return the launch information. If "True" then the launch information is written
    to a file in the transient volume and a FMS ticket is returned in the ticket field of the LaunchInfoResponce
    structure. If "False" then the launch information is written to a string and that string is placed into the
    vviStrBufferOutputMap field of the LaunchInfoResponce structure. In the later case, the key name to be used is
    found in the "ClientId" option that is now required.
    
    "ClientId" - a unique string used to identify this call to the service.
       Is a required option when the "TransientVolume" option is "False".
    
    "Client" - string used to identify the client calling this service
        Currently the only value being recognized is "AW", which indicates that ActiveWorkspace is the desired client
    viewer.
    
    
    :var idAdditionalInfo: This is a generic mechanism for putting additional key/value pairs into the output launch
    information. This data is considered opaque to the service and the key/value pairs are simply output into the VVI
