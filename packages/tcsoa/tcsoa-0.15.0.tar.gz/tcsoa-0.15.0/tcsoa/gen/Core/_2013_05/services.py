        definition for the input type, this operation validates whether the combined property values makes up a unique
        value.
        
        The 'validateValues' operation can be called before other service operations that create new objects, such as
        the 'createObjects' or 'saveAsObjects' operations, in order to avoid errors that would occur during object
        creation due to invalid property values.  For example, if a large set of objects to be created is passed to the
        'createObjects' operation, where half of the set could fail due to invalid property values, the
        'validateValues' operation could be used to avoid those failures by checking whether the input object property
        values are valid.
        
        All of the input property names and their values should be included in 'ValidateInput' 'propValuesMap'.
        
        For user exit support, an existing user exit will be called if a specific property is specified along with
        additional input according to the user exit parameter names.  The specific property, referred to as the
        identifying property below, dictates which user exit will be called.  The additional input name and its value
        should also be include in 'ValidateInput' 'propValuesMap'.
        
        User exit name: 'USER_validate_dataset_name'
        Identifying property:
            'object_name': The Dataset name to be validated. This must be set in 'propValuesMap'
        Additional user exit parameter names:
            'vdnItemType': The Item type for the new Item, which has not necessarily been created yet.
            'vdnOldDataset': The old Dataset object for SaveAs.
            'vdnOldDatasetOwner': The old ItemRevision object.
            'vdnNewDatasetItemId': The Item ID for the new item, which has not necessarily been created yet.
            'vdnNewDatasetRevisionId': The ItemRevision ID for the new revision, which has not necessarily been created
        yet.
        
        Example 1:
        The following populated ValidateValuesInput will be used to call user exit for validating Dataset name:

        The user exit will be called if the specified property is either 'item_id' or item_revision_id along with
        additional input according to the user exit parameter names.
        Identifying property:
            'item_id': The Item ID to be validated.  This must be set in 'propValuesMap'.
        Additional user exit parameter names:
            'item_revision_id': The ItemRevision ID to be validated.  This must be set in 'propValuesMap'.
            'object_type': The type of Item or ItemRevision for which the ID is being validated. If this property is
        not specified, system will use 'businessObjectName' in 'ValidateInput' as 'object_type'.  
            'viriItemObject': For Revise, this is ItemRevsion object&rsquo;s parent Item object. For Create and SaveAs,
        this is optional and can be empty value if specified.
        
        Example 1:
        The following populated ValidateValuesInput will be used to call user exit for validating Item ID:

        Identifying property:
            'altid_of': The identifiable type object to which the alternate ID is associated.
        Additional user exit parameter names:
            'idcontext': The IDContext object which holds the cardinality rule for the given identifiable type object
        and the Identifier type object.
            'vaAltIdObject': The alternate ID object.
            'vaAltIdType': The Identifier type object.
        
        User exit name: 'USER_validate_alt_id'
        Identifying property:
            'idfr_id': The alternate ID which is to be validated against any of the naming rule associated with the
        Identifier type.
        Additional user exit parameter names:
            'idcontext': No longer used.
            'vaiIdfrType': The name of the Identifier type whose alternate ID is being validated.
            'vaiPatternName': The preferred name of the Identifier type or IdentifierRevision type wh ose alternate ID
        is being validated. Note:' USER_validate_alt_id' will choose 'pattern_name' as validating type if specified and
        will ignore 'idfr_type'.
        
        For the MFK uniqueness validation, it is important to note that the check for uniqueness is done against
        existing objects in Teamcenter and not between separate client inputs.  It is the responsibility of the client
        to validate whether separate input values in a single call would conflict with each other.
        
        The 'ValidateInput' 'operationType' input is currently a placeholder for future functionality that
        differentiates validation according to the workflow type, where validation for creating an object may be
        different then validation for saving an object.
        
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1:
        Prior to calling the service operation 'saveAsObjects', which may fail due to an error with any input property
        value, the client would call 'validateValues' for the properties to have Teamcenter check whether the values
        are valid.
        
        Use Case 2:
        Prior to making a call to the service operation 'createObjects' for several objects, the client wants to ensure
        that each object will be created with a unique identifier according to the MFK definition for the object type.
        The client would call 'validateValues' for the properties to have Teamcenter check that the values are valid
        and that the combined values would make a unique MFK value.

        This operation is used  to  generate the values for the autoassignable properties  when the user clicks on the
