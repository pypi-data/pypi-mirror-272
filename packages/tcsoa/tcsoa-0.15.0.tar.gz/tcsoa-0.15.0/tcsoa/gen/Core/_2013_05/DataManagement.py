    1-CREATE

    An error 74007 is returned by the generateNextValues operation if the operationType value is not in any of the
    above. 
    :var businessObjectName: The name of the business object for which the property values are to be generated. An
    error 39007 is returned by the generateNextValues operation if the type name is not valid.
    :var propertyNameWithSelectedPattern:  A map of  property name and  naming rule pattern  pairs( string/string ).The
    key is the property name for which the value is to be generated and the value is the naming rule pattern string
    selected for  that property. If no pattern is selected for the property  the pattern string  should be empty
    string. The caller should only pass the properties that are autoassignable.
    :var propValues: A map of property name and values list(string/vector) of all the properties that are provided as
    inputs to create/revise/save as action of an object excluding the properties whose values are needed to be
    generated.If a multi field key is configured on the object ,the values of the constituent properties of the multi
    field key other than the ones for which the values are currently being generated are obtained from this map in
    order to perform the validation.
    The entries in this map are also used to generate values for the autoassignable properties of some business objects.
    
    Eg:
    Identifier: "idContext" value is needed to generate "idfr_id" property value
    
    An error  74032 is returned if any of the above property values are not provided .
    
    The values of the properties are to be provided as strings. For non string type properties use the
    Property.toXXXString functions (ie. toDateString) to covert the actual values to a string.
    
    :var additionalInputParams: A map of extra information which is required by user exits to generate values.
    A map where the key (string) is a parameter name and the value (string) is the parameter value.
    
    Valid parameters are:
    
    "ruleSuffix":
    This is only used when Baseline action to be performed. 'PDR'  should be passed  as ruleSuffix  in case of Baseline
    action. An error 74030 is returned if invalid ruleSuffix is supplied.
    
    "sourceObject":
    The object that is being revised/saved  or  the parent object  during  Dataset creation . Its value should be
    passed as the object UID. An error 74031 is returned if this parameter is not provided during revise/save as
    action.  It is optional in case of  Dataset creation .
