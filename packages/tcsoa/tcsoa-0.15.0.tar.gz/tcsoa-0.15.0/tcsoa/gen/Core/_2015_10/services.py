        Failure to set a particular state value will result in a Partial Error with the clientId set to the name of the

        shared with all client application sharing the Teamcenter server session.

        deprecated from release Teamcenter 11.5.
        - refreshPOM - If true the business objects in the POM are refreshed before returning property values.  This
        ensures property data is up-to-date, but is a performance hit (client session).
        - objectPropertyPolicy - The name of the current object property policy. This can also be controlled through
        the ObjectPropertyPolicyManager in the SOA client framework  (client session).
        - maxOperationBracketTime - Time (seconds) to bracket to limit a  POM refresh (client session).
        - maxOperationBracketInactiveTime - Time (seconds) to bracket to limit a  POM refresh (client session).
        - usePolicyOnly - If true, only properties defined in the current Object Property Policy will be returned.
        Objects that are added to the updated list of the ServiceData without named properties by default are returned
        with all properties currently loaded in the POM.
        - formatProperties - If true, the display value of the property will be formatted, if there is an active
        property formatter is attached to it. If false, the display value of the property will not be formatted, even
        if there is an active property formatter attached to it (client session).
        - currentProject - The UID of the Project object (server session).
        - workContex - The UID of the WorkContext object (server session).
        - volume - The UID of the Volume object (server session).
        - local_volume - The UID of the LocalVolume object (server session).
        - groupMember - The UID of the GroupMember object (server session).
        - currentDisplayRule - The UID of the DisplayRule object (server session).
        - currentOrganization - The UID of the Organization object (server session).
        - locationCodePref - The CAGE/Location Code preference. This value is set on the Item attribute
        'fnd0OriginalLocationCode' when Item objects are created (client session).
        - currentChangeItem - The UID of the Change Item Revision business object for this session. This functionality
