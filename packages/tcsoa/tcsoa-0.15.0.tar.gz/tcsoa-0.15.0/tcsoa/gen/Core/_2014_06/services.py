        This operation checks if there is any FND_TraceLink relation starting or ending from input object(s). If
        FND_TraceLink relation exists for input object(s), then it gets the other end of FND_TraceLink relation and
        generates a trace report. 
        
        Trace links can be between following objects:
        1  Between occurrences of an ItemRevision

        If scope of search structure is defined for the getting trace report in input of this operation by sending top
        lines of BOMWindow instances, then matching trace link instances within the scope windows will be returned.

        target objects of trace link.

        will get default sorted in ascending direction.
        
        The output of this operation can be either sent to rich client to build the report or to MSExcel application.
        
        User can export this trace report to MSExcel application by sending appropriate exportTo mode in input. If the
        mode of export is "TraceReportMSExcelExport", then trace report will be exported to .xlsm file and this file
        ticket will be sent to rich client. Then rich client will download the file and open MSExcel application.

        When user runs traceability report on R1 requirement he will get R2 object as complying object and R3 will come
        as defining object.
        
        If filter will be added to show only Paragraph type objects, then nothing will be returned in Trace Report as
        the type is not matching with filter.
        
        If filter will be applied to a subtype of FND_TraceLink and above trace link is of type FND_TraceLink, then
        also empty trace report will be returned, as trace link type does not match with filter trace link type vector
        from operation input.
