        Authenticates the user's credentials and initialize a Teamcenter session for this client. The operation will
        throw an 'InvalidCredentialsException' if the 'username', 'password' or 'group' is not valid.
        When the client application is deployed to a 4Tier environment (communication through HTTP or TCCS) the login
        operation also contributes to the assignment of a Teamcenter server instance to the client session. The
        Teamcenter architecture varies from other client server architectures in that there is a dedicated instance of
        the Teamcenter server per client application. However, there are use cases where it is desirable for a single
        user to have multiple desktop applications running and each sharing a single instance of a Teamcenter server.
        This is controlled through the following elements:
        - 'hostPath'    From the Connection class constructor, this specifies  the address (URI) the Teamcenter server
        is hosted on.
        - 'username'    From this login operation, this specifies the user's Teamcenter user name.
        - 'sessionDiscriminator'    From this login operation, this identifies the client session.
        
        
        
        The 'hostPath' argument determines the server machine that the client connects to. Once there, the pool manager
        on that host uses the 'username' and 'sessionDiscriminator' arguments of the logon request to determine which
        Teamcenter server instance to assign the client to. If the pool manager has an existing Teamcenter server
        instance with the 'username'/'sessionDiscriminator' key, the client is assigned to that existing instance of
        the Teamcenter server, and therefore sharing the server with another client; otherwise, a new instance of the
        Teamcenter server is used. There are a few general scenarios for the 'sessionDiscriminator' argument:
        
        - Blank     If the user jdoe logs on to Teamcenter using two or more client applications using a blank
        'sessionDiscriminator' argument (for example, jdoe/ ), all of those clients are assigned to the same Teamcenter
        server instance. These client applications can be running on the same or different client hosts.
        - Constant     If the user jdoe logs on to Teamcenter using two or more client applications using a constant or
        fixed 'sessionDiscriminator' argument (for example, jdoe/MyApp ), those clients are assigned to the same
        Teamcenter server instance. This is similar to the blank 'sessionDiscriminator' argument; the difference is
        that only multiple instances of the client application using myApp started by jdoe share the same Teamcenter
        server instance.
        - Unique     If the user jdoe logs on using a unique random-generated string (for example, jdoe/akdk938lakc),
        the client application will be assigned to a dedicated instance of the Teamcenter server.
        
        
         
        The scenario you use depends on how your client application is used in the integrated environment. The most
        common case is the unique 'sessionDiscriminator' value.
