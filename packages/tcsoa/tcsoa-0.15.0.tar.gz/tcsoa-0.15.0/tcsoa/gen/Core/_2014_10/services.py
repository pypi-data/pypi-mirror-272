        """
        This operation can propagate  security or anyother teamcenter data based on the source object and applicable
        propagation rules. The propagateData operation should only be invoked when propagation rule is configured to
        run in background. 
        The propagation rule defined in BMIDE states what data from source to desination object has to be
        propagated.For example project_list, license_list from Item to ItemRevision.
        
         The term "security data" is an abbreviated form of any of the following methods for applying additional
        security settings on an object.
        - Assigning a Project(s) to an object
        - Removing object from a Project(s)
        - Attaching an ADA license(s) to an object
        - Detaching an ADA license(s) from an object
        - Setting any of the classification attributes:
        - o    ip_classification
        - o    itar_classification
        - < other attributes > Note that customers can add their own attributes and configure them in the BMIDE to be
        propagated along with the ip_classification, and itar_classification attributes.
        
        
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case: Propagate security data from Cpd0CollaborativeDesign to Cp0DesignElement.
        
        Propagation rule for use case :
        Source type                -- Cpd0CollaborativeDesign.
        Direction                    -- Reverse.
        Destination type        -- Cp0DesignElement.
        Operation                -- All.
        property name            -- mdl0model_object.
        Property group            -- Security group I.
        Traversal condition    -- 4GDtraversalcondition.
        Propagation condition -- 4GDpropagationcondition.
        Style                        -- Merge.
        Background                -- TRUE.
        
        Property Group for use case: 
        Property group name             -- Security group I.
        List of properties in a group -- project_list, licence_list.
        
        For this use case the propagation rule and the property group shown in the above two tables respectively are
        applicable.
        Here the values from the properties project_list and the license_list would be propagated from
        Cpd0CollaborativeDesign to Cp0DesignElement through the operation propagateData.
        
        The above use case is one data propagation example. As part of this project (023479-Project ADA propagation for
        CPD) we are adding propagation rules into 4GD and foundation template. Customers can also add more rules.

        This operation performs SaveAs on the input target business object and its related objects as new instances.
        Related objects are identifed using deep copy rules. Optionally, this method relates the new object to the
        input target object or to a default folder.
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1:     SaveAs without relate
        Client constructs the "SaveAs" dialog for a business object using SaveAs operation descriptor. The information
        returned by that operation allows client to construct the SaveAs dialogs and DeepCopy panels for user input.
        Once the user input is received, client makes subsequent invocation to this operation  to execute SaveAs on the
        object. The method is invoked with "relate" option as false.
        New object is created using values passed in. It is not found under Home / NewStuff folder / anyother parent
        object. The new object stays dangling.
        Use Case 2:     SaveAs and relate to default folder
        Client invokes SaveAs operation as mentioned in use case 1 with "relate" as true but chooses not to specify
        target object or relation. This operation will choose a default folder and choose a default relation to be
        used. The default folder is decided based on the value set for the preference, WsoInsertNoSelectionsPref. When
        the preference value is set as 1 the default folder will be the New Stuff folder of the service user. When the
        preference value is 2 the default folder will be the Home folder of the service user.
        Newly created object is related to the default folder using default relation. For any other value of the
        preference, the relation will not be created.
        Use Case 3:     SaveAs and relate to specified target object using specified relation
        Client invokes SaveAs operation as mentioned in use case 1. The input parameter carrying the relation info has
        the boolean "relate" flag which is true, a valid target object and a property name to which the relation is to
        be created.
        After a successful creation, this operation relates the newly created object to the specified target object
        using specified relation.

        Currently only Item and its subtypes are supported. Object ids are generated using information provided in

        This operation should be called in case of a specific requirement where ID Generation is independent of
        creating Objects. (e.g. in case of some CAD applications where ids are created first, used in the system with
        temporary objects which can be saved at the later point of time). In most of the cases

        and object creation. 
        This operation should be invoked when an ID Generation Rule is attached to a Business Object. To identify
        whether the ID Generation Rule is attached to the Business Object, check if 'fnd0IdGenerator' property points
        to the compound Create Descriptor of same Business Object.
