        Use cases:
        Most events are posted by Teamcenter server logic. Use this operation to make an event known only to your
        client code recorded in Audit Manager or supported by Subscription Manager.
        Use Case1: Auditing events
        This operation helps auditing Teamcenter objects history by logging audit records when event eventTypeName
        occurs on primaryObject.
        - When site preference TC_audit_manager is set to ON and no Audit Definition exists for object type
        primaryObject and the eventTypeName, no audit records will be logged. Audit Definitions are Audit Manager
        Application configurations and can be viewed in Audit Manager Application.
        - When site preference TC_audit_manager is set to ON and Audit Definition exists for object type primaryObject
        and the eventTypeName, audit records will be logged with all the information provided in the structure
        PostEventObjectProperties
        - No audit records are written when preference TC_audit_manager is set to OFF or if the event posted is not
        defined as Auditable.
        
        
        
        Use Case2: Subscription Notifications    
        the site preference TC_subscription is set to ON , users can create subscriptions for notifications for certain
        events on Teamcenter Objects  The event posted must be described as subscribable and there should also exist an
        associated subscription object for the notification to occur.
        
        Exceptions:
        >Service Exception.
        Throws ServiceException with error message, error code, error count and severity.  Error code and message will
        be returned as per which audit or notification operation failed during processing.
