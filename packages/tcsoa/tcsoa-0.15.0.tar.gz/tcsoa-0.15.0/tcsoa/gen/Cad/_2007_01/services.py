        Use cases:
        User needs to have attribute mappings defined in Teamcenter.
        
        For this operation, the dataset object type is passed as input. The client application uses the list of
        returned attribute mapping definitions to present the CAD attributes to the user that correspond to the correct
        Teamcenter attributes.
        
        
        Exceptions:
        >Service Exception    Thrown if any Teamcenter subsystem errors occur during the retrieval of all attribute
        mappings.
