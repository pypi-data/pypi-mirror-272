        """
        This operation can be used by a client developer to save any modifications made to a Teamcenter product
        structure through its runtime artifacts. A Teamcenter product structure is a persistent parent child
        composition and clients often deal with runtime artifacts of this persistent model. The runtime artifacts are
        primarily represented by BOMLine business objects and BOMWindow business objects along with the BOMLine
        properties. Modifications to the product structure are typically bulked up on the client and tracked through
        the BOMWindow. Once it is established that changes to a product structure can be saved this operation can be
        called passing in a handle to the BOMWindows that need to be saved.
        
        Use cases:
        In a typical usage of the saveBOMWindows operation, a client developer already has a Teamcenter product
        structure loaded with the runtime artifacts created. This means that the client developer has/creates handles
        to a BOMWindow, and BOMLine business objects that are part of that BOMWindow. Given this pre disposition,
        typical interaction with the client may involve addition of a new BOMLine or removal of a BOMLine,
        creation/removal of In Structure associations etc. In such cases, the changes to the product structure are
        tracked on the BOMWindow and when the changes are ready to be persisted, the client developer calls the
        saveBOMWindows operation.

        """
        This operation creates or updates absolute occurrences on an existing relative structure.  The structure will
        be configured with revision rule set in the preference TC_config_rule_name before any configuration changes are
        applied. The objects created or updated can include an absolute occurrence, assembly arrangement and datasets
        and are added to the ServiceData as created or updated objects.  Created forms are added as plain objects and
        updated forms are added as updated objects.
        
        Before creating the absolute occurrence or assembly arrangement, this operation will check whether either
        already exists.  If the occurrence or arrangement exists but the input attribute values differ from those
        already set, an attempt is made to update the values.
        This operation assumes the input is in a bottom up format such that if any failures occur, the structure that
        is updated will still be consumable.  For example:
        
        Parent assembly A and occurrence C are input into this operation along with subassembly B and occurrence D.  If
        occurrence D is updated successfully on subassembly B but an error occurs during the update of occurrence C on
        assembly A, the client can still access subassembly B.
        
        For objects of type dataset and form, this operation can create or update a new object instance and attach it
        as an override on the absolute occurrence.  For all object types, existing objects can be attached or removed
        as an override on the absolute occurrence.
        
        To help reduce the client overhead of sending all override information during a complete synchronization and
        avoid accidental removal of overrides coming from other clients, this operation allows the client to provide
        only the attributes it is interested in syncing when the complete flag is set to true.  For more information on
        complete synchronization, see the description for the complete input parameter.
