        This operation can be used to get the internal names and corresponding display values of all the access
        privileges in Teamcenter.  The display names of the privileges are used to display the privilege names in the
        User Interface in client specific locale.  Whereas, the internal privilege names are used for internal
        processing of the rule tree evaluation. Below is the list of access privileges in Teamcenter release 10.0. For
        functional information on each of these privileges please refer to the Access Manager guide in Teamcenter
        documentation.

        - Display the privilege names in Access dialog.
        - Display the privilege names in Extra Protection information dialog.
        - Display the privilege names in effective Access Control List (ACL) dialog.
        - Display the privilege tool tips in Named ACL panel.

        Applicable ACEs are picked up from the ACLs that are configured against the Access Manager Rules which are
        evaluated to true for the given business object based on details like the object's type, object's class, object
        attributes, object status and project to which it is assigned.  By looking at the effective ACL table end user
        will be able to understand what privileges or granted, what privileges are denied for the user on the object
        and, what ACL and Accessor Type are involved in either granting or denying a particular access privilege. For
