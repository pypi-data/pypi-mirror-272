        This operation creates or modifies an ADA_License business object for each 'LicenseDetails' supplied. The
        'LicenseDetails' contains information for properties such as license type, license ID, expiry date, lock date,
        reason, in accordance with, and associated users and groups, for a given license. If a specified license ID
        already exists, the rest of the property values are updated on that license. However, if the license ID does
        not exist, then a new license of the specified type and ID will be created, and the rest of the properties are
        set on the created license. The user performing the operation will need the privilege specified in the
        ADA_license_administration_privilege site preference to create/modify an ADA License. If a user does not have
        the necessary privilege or if there is a validation error, the operation would fail and the error is returned
        in the 'ServiceData'.
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1: Create an ADA license
        You can create a new ADA license of type ITAR/IP/Exclude using 'setLicenseDetails' operation by providing a
        unique license ID for the license using 'LicenseDetails' structure.
        
        Use Case 2: Modify an ADA License
        The following types of modifications can be done on existing ADA licenses using 'setLicenseDetails' operation.
        Other than the license ID and license type, all other parameters of the ADA licenses can be modified using this
        operation.
        - Set an expiry or lock date on a license
        - Unlock licenses by specifying a NULL date or a future date for lockDate parameter
        - Add new users and/or groups to a license
        - Remove users and/or groups from a license
        - Specify value for qualifying code of federal regulations for ITAR licenses
        - Set reason for a license
