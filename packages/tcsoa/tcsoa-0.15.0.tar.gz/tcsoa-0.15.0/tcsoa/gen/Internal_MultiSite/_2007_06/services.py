        """
        The 'describePublicationRecords' operation returns the PublicationRecord of published objects based on the
        TcEnterprise client information and the published object tag.
        
        This operation is integrated with Multi-Site Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework and is callable only in
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) based Multi-Site environment. This operation acts as a wrapper call to
        server side RPC function and hence is invoked from within the Multi-Site framework. Consequently no other
        clients can invoke this operation.
        
        Use cases:
        The 'describePublicationRecords' operation gets called via Object Directory Service (ODS) remote search in HTTP
        Multi-Site environment.  ODS Remote search returns list of the published objects as per search criteria. For
        the list of published object, describePublicationRecords operation is called to get the PublicationRecord
        properties on each object.
