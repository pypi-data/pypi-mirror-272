        The getMultisiteDashboard operation provides the historic dashboard data for each site in Multi-Site federation
        which helps to visualize the critical errors occurred during Multi-Site import, export and synchronization
        operations. It also helps to track and analyze the key data points to monitor the health of Multi-Site
        operation.
        
        Use cases:
        In the Multi-Site federation, a user can share the business objects among the participating sites, the client
        shares business object(s) using the remote import or remote export functionality. During the import/export
        operation errors can occur due to network, data condition etc. These errors should be tracked analyzed and
        displayed in dashboard so that the user can take appropriate actions.
