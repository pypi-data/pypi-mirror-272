        """
        This operation pastes an assembly item under a target assembly Item or replaces an existing assembly Item with
        a new assembly Item while retaining any in-context edits on the properties and attachments under the target
        assembly.  For the paste, the new assembly Item can be either a previously saved raw (with no child lines)
        Item, or the same assembly Item. For replace, the new assembly Item is always a saved raw assembly Item ( no
        child lines). A cloning rule controls which child lines and in-context attachments are to be cloned or
        referenced under the new assembly's BOMLine.
        
        Use cases:
        A user wants to reuse an existing assembly with occurrence effectivity 1-10, but wants the new assembly to have
        all the original in-context edits and attachments and then modify occurrence effectivity to 11-UP. User either
        wants the new assembly to be a new object or the same object itself which will be pasted under a target object.
        If user doesn't want the old item any more user can also replace the existing assembly with a new object. The
        new object or the same object ( in case of pasting the same object) will be modified according to a cloning
        rule before pasting onto the target. Then user can set new effectivities on original and the new assembly. 
        The cloning rule is specified by a preference "CopyAssemblyInContextTemplates" which points to another
        preference e.g. "Item.Item.CopyAssemblyInContext" implying that the source is of type "Item" and target is of
        type "Item". It specifies information on what objects to clone or reference. It will also include rules for any
        in-context attachments.
        Example clauses on the cloning rule are below.. Wildcard "*" refers to all objects:
        *:*:Attribute.items_tag:Clone
        *:*:Attribute.structure_revisions:Clone
        *:*:Attribute.bom_view:Clone
