        This operation obtains target classes under MRL and views that a given source classification object (ICO) can

        returns target classes at this step and next steps are not executed.
        1.    Search for the direct mapping classes based on class ID.
        2.    Search is done based on connection code attribute values of source ICO.
        3.    Vendor specific prefixes from the class associated with the ICO are removed and search is done.

        Use cases:
        The API will internally extract value for the class ID associated with input source ICO. 
        Checks will be done in following order.
        1.    Search for all views whose IDs match the given source class ID. If source class ID is
        "IS#MILTHGI_WIS$$MTH_MZYL10", search directly for "IS#MILTHGI_WIS$$MTH_MZYL10" views.

        a.    GTC base class: <GTC_BASE>
        b.    The connection to the machine side: <MACH>
        c.    The connection to the workpiece side: <WKPS>
