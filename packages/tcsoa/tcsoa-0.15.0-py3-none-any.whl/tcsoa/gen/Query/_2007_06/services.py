        The saved queries can be executed to yield results in 2 modes:
        
        - Flat mode: In this traditional execution mode, only the first-level  objects (corresponding to         the
        queried class) satisfying the query  are returned
        - Hierarchical/Indented mode: This mode is only applicable for saved queries that allow        
        Hierarchical/Indented results. In this execution mode, the first-level objects as well as any         sub-level
        objects satisfying the query criteria are returned. The hierarchy level information is         also returned so
        that result subsets can be  re-constructed using the resulting objects.

        DataManagementService.loadObjects operation to load objects by pages.  See the         QueryInput and
        QueryResults data structures for usage details.

        Execute a set of saved queries of following types: QRY_RUN_BY_TC,  QRY_RUN_BY_KEYWORD_SEARCH and
