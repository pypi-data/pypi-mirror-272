        This service operation fetches the information related to process resource (work content performed by
        resource(s) in a manufacturing plant ) and the operation/process that are allocated/unallocated to
        process-resource. The operation takes object for which information is required. The object can be process
        station, process line, process area, or process resource. The object must be in the context of Plant Bill of
        Processes (BOP).
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1: Fetching process resource for a given process area.
        This operation can be used to fetch the process resource of specific process area. In context of a Plant BOP,
        this operation can be called on the process area BOM line. In response, all the process lines and process
        stations under the process area are fetched apart from  process resources for each process station and
        allocated/unallocated operations/processes. The result is populated on a view providing information on process
        resources, process station it belongs to and allocated/unallocated operations/processes.
        
        Use Case 2: Fetching processes/operations for a given process resource.
        This operation can be used to fetch the process/operation that are allocated to process resource. 
        In context of a Plant BOP, this operation can be called on the process resource BOM line. In response, all
        allocated/unallocated operations/processes are fetched. The result is populated on a view providing information
        on process resources and allocated operations/processes.
        
        Use Case 3: Fetching processes/operaions that are not allocated to process resource for a given process area 
        and process
        This operation can be used to fetch the process/operation that are not allocated to process resource. In
        context of a Plant BOP, this operation can be called on the process area or process BOM line. In response, all
        unallocated operations/processes are fetched. The result is populated on a view providing information on
        process resources and unallocated operations/processes.

        engineering BOM (eBOM) planning or clones a process in Bill Of Processes as a reaction to changes in mBOM
        planning. As a result of this operation, the original assembly/process is cloned and occurrence effectivity is
        set correctly on both original and cloned assembly/process.
        
        For eBOM-mBOM cloning some of the parts from the new assembly in the mBOM are replaced with the new parts that
        were introduced to the eBOM as a replacement in that unit effectivity.
        
        For mBOM-BOP cloning the process that used to refer to the original assembly in the mBOM is cloned and all
        references are fixed to point at the new assembly.
        
        Use cases:
        Clone subassembly with effectivity Use Case.
        Use Case Description:
        In this use case, the user detects changes in the eBOM, and would like to make the appropriate changes to the
        Mbom. The changes entail cloning the target assembly where the parts are in the mBom.
        Use Case Goal:
        Handle changes in eBOM by creating the appropriate stock-able assembly in the mBom.
        
        Description:
        This use case may be regarded as a direct continuation of the Clone assembly with effectivity Use Case. In this
        use case, the user continues to handle the change, by cloning the process to which the "original" assembly was
        assigned (and its hierarchy), and fixing all internal references to the new copy.
        Use Case Goals:
        Handle changes in mBom by creating the appropriate structure to consume it in the BOP.
