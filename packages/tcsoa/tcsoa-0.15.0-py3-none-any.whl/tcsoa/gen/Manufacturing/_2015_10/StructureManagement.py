    :var unitRangeText: Effectivity unit range, for example "5-10". Multiple range can also be provided, for example
    "3,5-10,20-50". This range belongs to the end Item which is part of the structrue on which the unit effectivity is
    applied.
    Valid unit ranges are:
     -StartUnit
    -StartUnit - EndUnit
    -StartUnit - SO
    -StartUnit - UP
            where, StartUnit <= EndUnit 
    -StartUnit1 - EndUnit1, StartUnit2 - EndUnit2(Ex: 10 - 12, 15, 16 - UP)
            where StartUnit2 > EndUnit1.
    - All units are positive integers
    
    For example, the effectivity can be 3 - 5 where 3 is start unit and 5 is end unit.
    It can also be 3 - UP where 3 is start unit and "UP" means anything above the start unit. "UP" and "SO" indicates
    open ended effectivity.  "SO" is stock out means effectivity will be applicable till the stock out condition.
    :var dateRange: The list of effectivity date range. For instance, opened date range could be specified as "05 Jan -
    UP" and closed date range as "01 Jan - 03 Apr". The list may have any number of opened and closed date range. For
    example, If you select multiple dates such as start date 19th May 2015 and End date 22nd May 2015 , start date 19th
    June 2015 and end date 22nd June 2015, the dataRange list have 4 values as below : 2015-02-19, 2015-05-22,
    2015-06-19,2015-06-22.
    :var openEndedStatus: Effectivity open ended status.
    - 0 : for closed unit range effectivity or date effectivity.
    - 1 : for opened unit range effectivity or date effectivity (UP).
    - 2 : for opened unit range effectivity or date effectivity stock out (SO).
    For example, if you select open ended effectivity such as start date 19th May 2015 and end date "UP", the dateRange
    list has 2015-05-19 with "openEndedStatus" value as "1".
