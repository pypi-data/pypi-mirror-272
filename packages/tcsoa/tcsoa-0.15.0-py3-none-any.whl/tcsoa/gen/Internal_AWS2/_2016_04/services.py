        This operation returns the stylesheets and the required data to present that stylesheet for each input object.
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1: Open an object in ActiveWorkspace.
        When an object is selected in ActiveWorkspace, the user may choose to invoke the open operation. When that
        operation is executed the getStylesheet call is invoked and the Stylesheet is processed in order to display the
        data to the user.
        
        Use Case 2: List view with Summary
        When an object is selected in the ActiveWorkspace navigator, when in list view with summary mode, the
        getStyleSheet SOA operation is invoked, and the returned data is parsed/processed in order to present the data
        to the user in the Summary panel.
        
        Use Case 3: Show Object Info
        When an object is selected in ActiveWorkspace, a user may choose the "Show Object Info" command.  When
        executed, a panel slides out from the right hand side of the application, and the selected objects data is
        presented.  In order to populate the panel, the getStylesheet call is invoked and the returned data is parsed
        and processed in order to build the UI.
