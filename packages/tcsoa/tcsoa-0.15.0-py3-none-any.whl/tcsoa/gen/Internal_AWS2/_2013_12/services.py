        This operation searches for active GroupMember based on name, role and group inputs . Literal and partial
        strings (strings with wildcard character '*') are supported. Literal string are AND together and partial
        strings are grouped OR and AND with with the literal strings.
        Using the following search critera:
        
        userId = "tc*"
        userName =  "tcadmin"
        groupName = "dba"
        roleName = "DB*"

        username = "tcadmin" AND groupName = "dba" AND ( userId = "tc*" OR roleName = "DB*" ). 
        
        Following examples demonstrate how this operation can be used to get GroupMember objects based on different
        inputs:
        
        - Search for GroupMember objects which  have User objects where userd_id, user_name contain  "XYZ". Input for
        this search will be :
        
        
        userId   - "*XYZ*"
        userName - "*XYZ*"
        
        - Search for GroupMember objects which have User or Role or Group objects where userd_id, user_name,
        role_name,or name contain  "xyz". Input for this search will be :

        - Search for GroupMember objects which have User or Role objects where userd_id,user_name, role_name contain 
        "xyz" and has Group object with name "dba". Inputs for this search will be :

        Use cases:
        Search GroupMember(s) againt signoff profile of a select-signoff task:
        
        User has an active select-signoff-task with signoff profile. Profile specifies the group, role and number of

        - dba / * / 1 ( Any User who is in  group "dba" )
        - dba / DBA / 1 ( Any User who has a role "DBA" and in group "dba" )
