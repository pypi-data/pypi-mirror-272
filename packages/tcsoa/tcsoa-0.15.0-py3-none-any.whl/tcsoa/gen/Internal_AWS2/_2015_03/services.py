        The Initial Condition for this use case is that all the data from Teamcenter database has already been indexed
        in the Search Engine. When there are Access Manager rule tree changes and the change has a global impact, then
        all of the indexed data has to be refreshed. In order to identify the globally impacted objects, an application
        ID called :FTS_REFRESH (a unique identifier representing the Full Text Search Refresh operation) is registered
        with TIE (Teamcenter Import Export). Once the indexing is complete and there are no more objects left to be
        refreshed, this operation is invoked to deregister and to signal to TIE that the necessary cleanup of data in
        the database can be done. This is necessary to limit the growth of the database tables used by TIE.
