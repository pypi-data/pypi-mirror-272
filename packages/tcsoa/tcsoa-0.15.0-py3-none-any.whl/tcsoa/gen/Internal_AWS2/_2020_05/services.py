        For example, if a configured ItemRevision is cut, and its related Item is in database, the Item is likewise cut
        (from database). Similarly, when a specific ItemRevision is cut and the ItemRevision is in the database, only
        the ItemRevision is cut (from database). For business objects other than ItemRevision, if the object displayed

        the client side to make search more configurable and convenient for user. Client needs to render these setting

        This operation can be invoked by the Active Workspace client with at least one of the input objects of type
        Dataset, this means Active Workspace client enables the Download command when at least one of the selected

        the invalid selection.
        
        The primary named reference of the Dataset is defined through its definition using the BMIDE tool of
        Teamcenter. This operation finds the primary named reference using the Tool Actions and the Reference
        definitions of the type Dataset. Tool Actions of the type Dataset defines the mapping of the operation on the
        Dataset with the named reference and the Reference definition of the Dataset maps the named reference and the
        extension of the file. Citing an example , if there are multiple files associated with the named reference i.e
        &lsquo;Text&rsquo; , the first file associated with this named reference is selected. In case , the first file
        is deleted , the second file associated with this named reference takes precedence.

        Use Case 1:
        &#61656;    In Active Workspace client, when user selects  Dataset objects and clicks on the "Download" command

        Use Case 2:
        &#61656;    In Active Workspace client, user selects the Dataset objects and clicks on the "Copy File Download
        Link" command to copy the URL of the file on the Teamcenter and OS clipboards. When the copied file download
        link is hit by the user on a different page then the client starts downloading the file directly from the FMS
