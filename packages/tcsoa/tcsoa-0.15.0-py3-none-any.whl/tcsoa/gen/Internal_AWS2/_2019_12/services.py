        This operation fetches the possible filter values (Facets) of a given column in a table. Each table in Active
        Workspace is typically backed by a provider, so the input of this operation is similar to performSearch
        operation&rsquo;s searchInput request. 
        The framework allows a custom solution to be able to provide a new specific provider to collect data, perform
        sorting and filtering. The provider can be a User Inbox retriever or Full Text searcher, for example. The new
        data provider can be encapsulated via a new runtime business object from Fnd0BaseProvider class. The
        implementation is done using its fnd0performSearch operation.
        
        RuntimeBusinessObject 
        ---- Fnd0BaseProvider (foundation template) 
        -------- Fnd0GetChildrenProvider(foundation template)

        -------- Awp0TaskSearchProvider (aws template) 
        -------- Aos0TestProvider (aosinternal template) 
        -------- etc.
        
        This operation provides a common interface to get Filter Facet values in a generic way from any data provider
        that is compatible with performSearch operation. This operation takes the data provider which is responsible
        for fetching the objects, a columnName one which the filter values need to be obtained, and a filter or query
        criteria which is used to refine the filter facet values. Once the query or filtering is complete, the ui
        values are obtained from the search results and are returned as the facet values.
        
        Use cases:
        User clicks on "Name" column in Home Folder and clicks on Show Filters to expand the possible Filter facet
        values
        A getFilterValues request will be made by passing in the needed query or filter criteria. In this case the
        provider name is "Awp0ObjectSetRowProvider". The provider is responsible for fetching the objects of the Home
        Folder, then it queries for the Name property of all the objects returned by the data provider and returns a
        unique sorted UI values for the "Name" column. These are the facet results and are shown in a list of
        checkboxes in a column menu in the client.
