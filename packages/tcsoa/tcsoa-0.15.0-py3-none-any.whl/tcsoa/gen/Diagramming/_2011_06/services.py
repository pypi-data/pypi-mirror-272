        This operation opens a Visio Diagram created for a Teamcenter object (WorkspaceObject/ Item Revision/ Folder/
        BOMLine). The objects and relations shown on the diagram are gathered by executing the Transfer Mode and
        Relation Rule specified on the diagram template. Relation Rule specifies the relations to be shown between the
        objects.
        Only those objects appear on the diagram for which there is a Visio Shape in the stencil and there is mapping
        defined between the Shape and the Teamcenter object in the mapping xml file. Mapping file has details about how
        to define the mappings.
        If the contents of the root object of the diagram are changed, for instance, a BOM structure changes or the
        contents of the folder are modified, then the diagram will show only the current information. This is because
        every time a diagram is opened, Transfer mode and Relation Rules are applied.
        
        Use cases:
        You can select a Teamcenter object and launch the open diagram dialog which shows the list of all diagrams
        created for that object. You can select a diagram to open. A Visio diagram is opened on the RAC. The content of
        the diagram is decided by the Transfer mode and the Relation Rule.

        the non Teamcenter information, like notes if any. A preview image of the diagram content is also stored as an
        image data set. These Dataset objects are attached to the diagram object.
        For the Teamcenter business objects appearing on the diagram, Fnd0ShapeRelation objects are created with the
        diagram object to hold the position information so that the shapes appear in their original position and format
        next time the diagram is opened.
        
        Use cases:
        You can create or open an existing diagram and make changes to it. You can then save the diagram.
