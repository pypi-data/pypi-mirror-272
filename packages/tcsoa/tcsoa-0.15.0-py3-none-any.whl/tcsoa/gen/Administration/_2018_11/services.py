        This operation gets all the session information in the form of key values map only if valid sessionInfoTicket
        is provided by client. Each key corresponds to particular session attribute like user, roles, groups, project
        teams, and licenses. For each entry in the keys array, the corresponding entry in the values array contains the
        values for that specific session attribute. Session information returned from this operation is used during
        read expression evaluation in external clients to determine the READ privilege to the current logged in user on
        the indexed Teamcenter data.
        
        Use cases:
        VDS (Visualization Data Server) has no user concept or connection authentication by design. TC SessionInfo
        passed to VDS clients after valid Teamcenter login but no validation is done by VDS today. Due to this
        shortcoming VDS is potential for spoofing, user session hacking and session reuse. To overcome this issue two
        new service operations are proposed and will be used. Calling client VDS uses getSessionInfoTicket operation to
        get encrypted (tamper proof) data packet and preserves the encrypted string. VDS calls SOA
        GetSessionInfoFromTicket with this ticket to get back the user session information. GetSessionInfoFromTicket
        returns back the session information only if the ticket is not expired.
