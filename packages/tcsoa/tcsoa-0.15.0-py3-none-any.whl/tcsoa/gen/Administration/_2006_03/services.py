        This operation gets the verdicts for the given access privileges for the given GroupMember on the given set of
        business objects.  This operation finds the accessors for the combination of given groupMember's user, role and
        group and then uses the list of found accessors to determine the verdicts for the given access privileges for
        the given GroupMember on the given business objects. The business objects can be any POM_object.  Privilege
        Names must be internal names of the Access Manager AM_Privilege objects.  If a privilege object with any of the
        given names does not exist in the system then this operation will return the error 525101.  However, evaluation
        of the valid privilege names will continue. Following are the list of valid privilege names. For functional
        description about these privileges please refer to the Access Manager guide in Teamcenter documentation.
