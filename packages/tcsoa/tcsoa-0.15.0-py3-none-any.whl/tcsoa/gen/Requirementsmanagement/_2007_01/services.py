        MSWord outline level in the document.  Each Paragraph that is formatted in an outline level style produces a
        separate Requirement. This file may be located in a local file system folder or a network folder.  This
        operation supports MSWord documents in MS Office Open XML format (.docx format) only.
        
        Use cases:
        User can create an MSWord document and import it using this operation to create a structure. Each Paragraph in

        format is MSWordXML then the generated document is a Word document.  If the application format is MSExcel then
        the generated sheet is a static Excel spreadsheet.  If the application format is MSExcelLive then the generated
        sheet is a Live Excel spreadsheet. "Live" sheet means that modifications can be done to the data in MSExcel
        which will reflect to Teamcenter. 
        
        
        Use cases:
        User can create Teamcenter objects in RAC and then export those objects and their properties to MSWord or
        MSExcel. If "Live" option is selected then User can create "Live" spreadsheet after export to MSExcel.
        
        Following usecases are supported in this operation
        
        - Export of Workspace objects to MSWord (static)
        - Export of Teamcenter objects to MSExcel(static)
        - Export of Teamcenter objects to MSExcel(Live) and edit the properties from Excel Live sheet.
