    :var isModifiable: Specifies whether the property is modifiable

    - Is it a hierarchical LOV attachment? If it is hierarchical LOV attachment, the specifier value is 0;  This value
    can be 0 in following cases:
    -     Standard LOV attachment (Combobox, Range etc)
    -     Value Ddescription attachment only ( specifier value is 0 for the value attachment )
    -     To check whether it is hierarchical or not, one needs to verify the children LOVs (value filters from LOV).
    If there are children LOVs then it could be a hierarchical LOV.
    -  Is it attached with interdependent?
    - bool isInterdependent = ( specifier & (1 << 1) ) != 0;
    -  Is it attached with description attachment?
    - bool  isDescriptionAttach = ( specifier & (1 << 1) )!= 0;

        0:  No attachments

        3:  One or more object based conditions are attached
    
    :var interdependentProps: Interdependent properties for interdependent LOVs.

    :var propType: Type for the property in integer form: 
    PROP_unknown (0) Property type is unknown
    PROP_attribute (1)  Based on a POM attribute (int, string, ...)
    PROP_reference (2)  Based on a POM reference
