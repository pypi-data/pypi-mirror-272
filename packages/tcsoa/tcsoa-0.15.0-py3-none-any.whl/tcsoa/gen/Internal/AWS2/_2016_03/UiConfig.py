    "Group" - Returns the configuration defined for a specific Teamcenter Group.
    "Role" - Returns the configuration defined for a specific Teamcenter Role.
    "User" - Returns the configurations defined for a specific Teamcenter User.
    "LoginUser" - Returns the configurations defined for the current login user.
    :var scopeName: The name of a valid Teamcenter scope. Valid scopes are "Site", "Group", "Role", "User",
    "LoginUser". ScopeName should be empty when scope is set for "Site" or "LoginUser". For other scopes use as follows
    
    User    -   User name as per the user's profile
    Group  -   Valid group defined in Organization
    Role    -   Valid role defined in Organization
    :var clientName: The name of a client application, as represented by an instance of Fnd0Client in the Teamcenter
    database. This value must match the value of fnd0ClientName property.
    
    Ex: The client name for Active Workspace is "AWClient".
    :var hostingClientName: Specifies the name of a hosting client application, as represented by an instance of
    Fnd0Client, in the Teamcenter databases. This value must match a value of the fnd0ClientName property. 
    
    For example, if client A is integrated with client B and the user can invoke client B commands from within client
    A, the input to getUiConfigs3 service operation would specify client A as hosting client and client B as the
    client. If the caller wanted native commands for client A, client A would be specified as client and hosting client
    would be empty.
