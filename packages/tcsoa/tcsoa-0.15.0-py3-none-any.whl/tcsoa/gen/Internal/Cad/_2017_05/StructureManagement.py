    The data structure contains occurrence override data for an arrangement&rsquo;s occurrence. If there are no
    overrides for the occurrence (possible in the case of a base arrangement), the override type is 0. 
    There can be only one transform override on an occurrence per arrangement, and only one suppression override. If
    the occurrence is a subassembly, there may also be at most one used arrangement identified.
    For a base arrangement, there may be multiple transform overrides and there may be multiple geometry (jt) overrides.

    value is 3.
