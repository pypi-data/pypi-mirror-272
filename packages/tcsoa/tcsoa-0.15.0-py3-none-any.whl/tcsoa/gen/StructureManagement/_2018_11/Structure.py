Interchangeable Group properties and values. This map is of property name (as key) and property values (as value) in string format. Each value is a list of strings to support both single valued and multi valued properties of types. The calling client is responsible for converting the different property types (like integer, double, date, etc) to a string using the appropriate to< type >String function (e.g. toIntString and toDateString) in the client framework's Property class.
