    :var item: An optional object reference of the Item containing launch able object. If this is not known, the server
    will attempt to identify the parent if it can.
    :var itemRev: An optional object reference of the ItemRevision containing launchable object. If this is not known,
    the server will attempt to identify if it can.
    :var operation: An optional parameter references the type of launch action. This controls the action the viewer
    will perform when it opens the object. The actions supported are one of following: 'Open', 'Insert', 'Merge' or
    'Interop'.  'Open' will open the object in a new window.  'Insert' will insert the object into the current window
    that has focus.  'Merge' will attempt to merge a pruned product structure with one that is already open if it can. 
    'Interop' will present a dialog that lets the user select the launch action.
