class IdInfo2(TcBaseObj):
    """
    A Teamcenter object structure that contains the related information that need to be visualized in Teamcenter
    Visualization.
    
    :var object: The business object to be laucnhed. Launched object could be Item, ItemRevision, Dataset,
    BOMView_Revision, BOMView. The business object will be resolved by the server in some cases (e.g. Item or
    ItemRevision launch) to a directly launchable visualization object (such as a DirectModel Dataset or
    BOMViewRevision).
    :var item: The parent or containing Item of the launched object (object).  If this is not known, the server will
    attempt to identify the parent if it can.  If the parent information cannot be identified, this will not result in
    an error condition, it simply will not pass the information to the visualization client which for some cases may
    affect what features are available in the client.
    :var itemRev: The parent or containg ItemRevision of the launched object (id). If this is not known, the server
    will attempt to identify the parent if it can.
    :var operation: The type of launch action the viewer is instructed to perform (e.g. open, insert, merge, etc).  If
    left empty, it will default to open. This controls the action the viewer will perform when it opens the object. The
    following actions are supported: 
    1. open - Open the object in a new window. 
    2. Insert - Insert the object into the current window that has focus.
    3. merge - Attempt to merge a pruned product structure with one that is already open (and has focus) if it can.
    4. Interop -Present a dialog that lets the user select the launch action.
    :var idAdditionalInfo: This is a generic mechanism for putting additional key value pairs into the VVI file that
    control viewer launch behavior.
    :var structureMode: This specifies the structure launch mode to open the structure object in Teamcenter
    Visualization. The different structure launch modes that are supported are:
    1. Dynamic - When this mode is used, it launches the dynamic structure in Teamcenter Visualization.
    2. Static - When this mode is used, it launches the static structure in Teamcenter Visualization.
    3. Preference - This specifies that Teamcenter Visualization preference is used to launch the structure.
    4. Ask - This mode of launch asks user to specify the launch mode.
    :var clientId: This is the UID of the launched object against which the VVI string buffer will be stored.

    allows the viewer to share an existing tcserver.exe session with the launching client. This should be the same as
    the SessionDescriminator argument of the SessionService.login operaiton.  If this empty string, the viewer will
    present a login prompt if it does not already have a session established.

    of key value pair (key (string) = value(/stirng)).(Refer to Teamcenter Visualization VVI documentation on
    acceptable additional information).
