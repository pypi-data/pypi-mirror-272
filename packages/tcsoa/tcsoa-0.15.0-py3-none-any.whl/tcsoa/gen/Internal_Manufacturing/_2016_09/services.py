        """
        For Manufacturing planning both Bill of Equipment (BOE) and Plant Bill of Process (Plant BOP) are required. BOE
        stations hold location information and contain the equipment required for manufacturing. Plant BOP stations are
        used to define the sequences of the processes and hold information about the parts to be assembled in the
        station. The validation of the manufacturing process usually requires the combination of BOE and Plant BOP.
        This operation will create the Plant structures for the given input Plant BOP structures. The decision to
        create objects will be based on a preference. The preference MEBOPToBOEObjectTypeMap will hold the information
        about the mapped objects types which needs to be created. The new objects created will have same attribute
        values as that of originating object.
        
        Use cases:
        Use case 1: User create Plant structure for the selected Plant Bill of Process (Plant BOP)
        New BOE structure will be ceated for given Plant BOP structure. As part of the structure creation,
        MEAppearancePathNode will also be created for each line in the source (Plant BOP) and target (Plant) structure.
        The MEAppearancePathNode object of Plant BOP line will be connected to MEAppearancePathNode created for object
        in Plant with a GRM Relation Mfg0MELinkedBOERel. Station (MEStation) created in Plant structure (MEPlant) for
        any Station Process (Mfg0MEProcStatn) in Plant BOP (Mfg0MEPlantBOP) will be consumed in Station Process
        (Mfg0MEProcStatn).
