        """
        This operation imports STEP 3D model files for Generic Tool Catalog (GTC) Packages. The STEP files are
        converted to NX part and to JT file format and imported into Teamcenter. If needed, items are created for the
        Classification objects (ICO). One UGMaster dataset for the NX part file and one DirectModel dataset for the JT
        file is created below the (new) item. 
        
        
        Use cases:
        There are two different use case s:
            A) The specified ICO is classified in a vendor catalog class
        (the ICO has an attribute -159003 "3D Model file name")
            B) The specified ICO is classified in an MRL MyComponents class
        (the ICO does not have an attribute -159003 "3D Model file name")
        
        In use case A, this operation retrieves the file name of the 3D model directly from GTC attribute 
        -159003 "3D Model file name".
        (Another attribute ID instead of -159003 can be defined in the "MRMGTC3DModelAttributeID" preference.)
        
        In use case B, the SOA operation checks if there is an Manufacturing Resource Library (MRL) attribute -40930
        "Vendor Reference Object ID" in the given ICO. This attribute is used to store the reference from the MRL
        MyComponents ICO to the GTC vendor catalog ICO. If this attribute exists in the ICO's class and has a valid ICO
        ID as value, the 3D model file name will be retrieved from the referenced ICO. (see use case A)
        (Another attribute ID instead of -40930 can be defined in the "MRMGTCReferenceObjectAttributeID"preference.)
        
        The SOA operation retrieves the information about the server-sided directory, where all STEP 3D models of the
        catalog are stored, based on the class of the GTC vendor catalog ICO.
        
        If there is a problem during importing one of the 3D models, the operation will continue importing the 3D
        models of the following ICOs.
        
        This operation is very similar to importStep3DModels(). The difference is that this new operation returns in
        addition to the service data also information about the ICO and the newly created item.
        
        Note: The Graphics Builder has to be configured properly for this operation to work.

        can decide if datasets from a source item should be copied to the tartget item.
        
        Use cases:
        A typical use case when this operation can be used is the mapping of ICOs from the Generic Tool Catalog (GTC)
        classes into the Manufacturing Resource Library's (MRL) tool component classes. The GTC classes contain catalog
        tool components. In the MRL tool component classes are those tool components that are actively used in the
        customer's shopfloor.
        In the Classification Admin application are mapping rules (Mapping Views) defined that control which GTC class
        is mapped on what MRL class and which GTC attribute is mapped on what MRL attribute.
        During the mapping operation a new item and ICO are created in the MRL class and the attribute values from the
        source ICO are transferred into the target ICO. If the source component has a dataset attached, this operation
        allows to copy the dataset to the new target component.
