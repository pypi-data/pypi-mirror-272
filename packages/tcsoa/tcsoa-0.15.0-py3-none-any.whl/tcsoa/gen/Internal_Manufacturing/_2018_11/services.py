        This service operation converts the URL representing a BOMLine to a BOMLine instance. Additionally, returns a
        structure which encapsulates the CCObject or StructureContext representing the context. The parent chain of the

        Use cases:
        A user can capture the links from Teamcenter representing the BOMLine objects using a utility like
        tc_to_intosite, and use those links with this API to reconstruct the BOMLine objects that were used to create
        the links. These BOMLine objects will have the same configuration and context as the time of the link creation.

        """
        This operation positions a newly added target component so that it fits to the source component geometrically
        based on coordinate systems (CSYSs). This opeation is used when the user 
        a) adds a classified component, 
        b) adds a component with Guided Component Search (GCS) or 
        c) adds a component with copy and paste 
        in Teamcenter Rich Application Client (RAC).
        The source object can be a component, a CSYS or a GCS Connection Point (CP).
        
        This operation analyses the source and target CSYSs and GCS CPs and does the geometrical positioning by setting
        the transformation matrix in the target component BOMLine. (In one specific case (GCS Add Upwards), the target
        component is positioned to the zero position and the source position is adjusted correspondingly.)
        
        If the source object is a component or a GCS CP, it can happen that there are multiple possible source CSYSs.
        In this case the operation returns those CSYSs in the response object and does NOT autoposition, if no specific
        source CSYS was specified. The operation has to be called in that case again with an unique source CSYS.
        
        If the target object (always a component) has multiple possible target CSYSs, the operation returns those CSYSs
        in the response object and does NOT autoposition, if no specific target CSYS was specified. The operation has
        to be called in this case again with an unique target CSYS.
        
        Use cases:
        When the user creates resource assembly in Resource Manager components will be positioned correctly if both
        parent and child components have appropriate CSYSs. The user can do add/paste/GCS add components by selecting a
        component, CSYS or selecting one or multiple GCS CP lines. The system then analyzes the CSYSs under the parent
        and child component and carry out the positioning. If there are appropriate multiple CSYS for positioning, the
        system asks the user to select one of them.
