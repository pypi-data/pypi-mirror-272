        This operation recommits the file  after it has been cleaned out from local volume by the File Management
        System (FMS) StoreAndForward feature. This operation is intended for use only by the DatabaseOperations()
        method of an FMSTransferTool transfer task running in a Dispatcher Client context.
        The File Management System (FMS) StoreAndForward feature redirects uploads to a temporary volume that is close
        to the uploading user, called a Default Local Volume. The system then transfers the file to its final home in a
        Default Volume in a background FMSTransferTool process executed on a Dispatcher Module.
        The first step of the background operation is to copy the file(s) from the Default Local Volume to the Default
        Volume and  commit the new volumes of each file to the Teamcenter database. The second step of the background
        operation is to clean up the files from local volume. Finally the task invokes this operation to re-commit the
        destination volume to null for each file to the Teamcenter database.
