        an FMSTransferTool transfer task running in a Dispatcher Client context.
        The File Management System (FMS) StoreAndForward feature redirects uploads to a temporary volume that is close

        The first step of the background operation is to transfer the file(s) from the Default Local Volume to the

        dispatcher task invokes this operation to commit the new volumes of each file to the Teamcenter database.

        any outstanding FMS tickets expire.  This information is persisted in a second dispatcher task, which also
        executes in a background operation on a Dispatcher Module.
        The FMSTransferTool TaskPrep method invokes the 'getFileTransferTickets'() operation to obtain the FMS tickets
        necessary to transfer the files between the two volumes.  The tickets are written to a temporary file stored in
