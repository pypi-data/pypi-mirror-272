        Use cases:
        'idsm11RepublishObjectSvc' operation gets invoked for re-publishing the given object to ODS site after
        ownership transfer in use cases like remote import/export.  The ownership transfer operation performed on the

        has the wrong entry for the owning siteId in PublicationRecord at ODS site. In order to correct it, the BOs
        needs to be republished to the ODS server.
