        """
        This method returns valid background (MEAppearancePathNode or Absocc) UIDs for the respective target (APN or
        Absocc) UID and proximity. Given the top level ItemRevision object tag, RevisionRule name and list of 1:1
        target UIDs and proximity, list of valid background overlays is returned. Proximity search and Valid Overlays
        Only (VOO) filtering is applied on the APN target UIDs to obtain the valid APN background overlays. 
        Please note that the target UIDs provided could be APN or Absocc. If target UID are Absocc, then it is
        converted to APN UID before doing proximity search and Valid Overlay Only processing. Resulting APN background
        overlays are converted to Absocc before being sent to client, if the inputs were Absocc UIDs.
        If the 'abortOnError' flag is set to true, the method would abort even if it finds a single target UID that it
        cannot process. If it is set to false, it would process all the UIDs and return the respective failure codes to
        the client.
        
        Use cases:
        Use case 1: Perform Proximity Search and Valid Overlays Only filtering, for the target MEAPN UIDs, based on the
        proximity distance provided for each of them.
        
        Use case 2: Perform Proximity Search and Valid Overlays Only filtering, for the target Absocc UIDs, based on
        the proximity distance provided for each of them.
