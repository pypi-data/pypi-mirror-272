        This operation searches for objects with specified Application References and returns the matching Application
        References with specified Application names. Application Reference is a 3-tuple construct with name, label and
        version strings. This is used in PLMXML exchange between Teamcenter and target applications to uniquely
        identity Teamcenter entities like Item, ItemRevision, Form objects etc.
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1: Getting Teamcenter Application References for non Teamcenter Application References.
        This operation can be used to fetch the Application References of Teamcenter given non Teamcenter Application
        References. These are typically used in PLMXML interchange.
        Use Case 2: Getting non Teamcenter Application References for Teamcenter Application References.
        This operation can be used to fetch the Application References of non Teamcenter  Application References given
        Teamcenter Application References. These are typically used in PLMXML interchange.
