        This operation performs an action on an EPMTask or Signoff. This operation also allows user to digitally sign
        the target objects in a workflow.
         
        Note:
        The Teamcenter session should be configured with HTTPS as the password in the input structure is not encrypted.
        
        Following actions are supported on EPMTask.

        This action will delegate a Signoff to a different GroupMember or ResourcePool and records the comments
        supplied while performing delegate operation in the audit log. User may use workflowService.getResourcePool
        method To get the ResourcePool business object from only group or only role or both.
        
        Use cases:
        Use Case 1: User can perform a workflow task.
        Description: User can perform an EPMTask from worklist folder in rich or thin client. Similarly EPMTask can be
        performed or signed-off using office client as well. This operation can be used to perform or signoff the
        workflow tasks.
        
        Use Case 2: User can assign or delegate a Signoff to a different GroupMember or ResourcePool and provide
        optional comments while performing delegate operation.
        Description: When a user delegates a Signoff to a different GroupMember or ResourcePool,  the comments provided
        while performing delegate operation gets recorded in the audit log.
