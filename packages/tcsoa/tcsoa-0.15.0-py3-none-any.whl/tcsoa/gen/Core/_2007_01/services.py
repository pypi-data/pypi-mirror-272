        Sets the current object property policy. The business logic of a service operation determines what business
        objects are returned, while the object property policy determines which properties are returned on each

        returned based on how the client application uses those returned business objects. The policy is applied
        uniformly to all service operations. 
        By default, all applications use the Default object property policy, defined on the Teamcenter server
        '$TC_DATA/soa/policies/default.xml. 'It is this policy that is applied to all service operation responses until
        the client application changes the policy. Siemens PLM Software strongly recommends that all applications

        The object property policy is set to the policy named in the file '$TC_DATA/soa/policies/<policyName>.xml 'The
