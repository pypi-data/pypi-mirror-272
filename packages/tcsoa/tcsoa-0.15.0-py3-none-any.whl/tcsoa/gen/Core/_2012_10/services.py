        This operation will generate a Trace Report on the objects selected by user. The report will contain
        information about complying as well as defining objects which are connected to selected object using
        FND_TraceLink, or its subtype. This operation will check if there is any TraceLink relation starting or ending
        from selected object(s). If TraceLink relation exists for selected object(s), then it gets the other end of
        TraceLink relation and generates a trace report.  
        
        Trace links can be between following objects: 
        
        * Between occurrences of an ItemRevision 
        * Between any two WorkspaceObject. 
        
        Following will be added, in addition to existing getTraceReport operation: 
        
        * If scope of search structure is defined for the getting Trace Report in input of this operation by sending
        top lines of BOMWindow instances, then matching TraceLink instances within the scope windows will be returned. 
        * If input of this operation is having list of object type names, then object type filter will be applied to
        target objects of TraceLink. 
        * If input of this operation is having list of TraceLink type names, then those types of TraceLink will be
        returned in Trace Report. 
        * If propertyFilterInput is given in the input of this operation, then the additional filter of property will
        be applied on the output before sending to client. 
        * Trace report tree will be sorted for given property, sort direction can also be defined, if not defined then
        it will get default sorted in ascending direction. 
        * The output of this operation can be either sent to rich client to build the report or to MSExcel application. 
        * User can export this trace report to MSExcel application by sending appropriate exportTo mode in input. If
        the mode of export is "TraceReportMSExcelExport", then trace report will be exported to .xlsm file and this
        file ticket will be sent to rich client. Then rich client will download the file and open MSExcel application.

        the file extension as the key in the GetDatasetTypesWithFileExtensionOutput structure. The order of file
        extension in the GetDatasetTypesWithFileExtensionOutput structure may be different than the order of file
        extension input. This operation will insert file extensions that match the default dataset type defined in
        AE_default_dataset_type preference at the beginning of the list. This operation uses
        TC_Dataset_Import_Exclude_Wildcard preference to determine if wildcard may be used in file extension input. If
        the preference is set and file extension is set to asterisk, this operation will return all data set types that
        allow wildcards in its name reference in Teamcenter. Details about these two preferences can be found in
