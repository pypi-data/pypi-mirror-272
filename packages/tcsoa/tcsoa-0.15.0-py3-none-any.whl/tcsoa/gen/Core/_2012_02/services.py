        Sets the current object property policy. The business logic of a service operation determines what business
        objects are returned, while the object property policy determines which properties are returned on each
        business object instance. This allows the client application to determine how much or how little data is
        returned based on how the client application uses those returned business objects. The policy is applied
        uniformly to all service operations. 
        By default, all applications use the Default object property policy, defined on the Teamcenter server
        '$TC_DATA/soa/policies/default.xml. 'It is this policy that is applied to all service operation responses until
        the client application changes the policy. Siemens PLM Software strongly recommends that all applications
        change the policy to one applicable to the client early in the session.
        The object property policy is set to the policy named in the file '$TC_DATA/soa/policies/<policyName>.xml' The
        reserved policy name "Empty", will enforce a policy that only returns minimum data required for each object
        (UID and type name).The object property policy will stay in affect for this session until changed by another
        call to 'setObjectPropertyPolicy'.  The full policy is returned where the client application can modify it
        throughout the session via calls to 'updatObjectPropertyPolicy'.
        
        Like any other service operation, this operation cannot be called before establishing a session with the
        'login' serivce operation, so if you need a policy other than the Default policy for the business objects
        returned by the login operation, use the _2011_06 version of the 'login/loginSso' operation to authenticate and
        establish a session without returning business objects. The 'setObjectPropertyPolicy' operation can then be
        called to establish the policy for the session.

        The 'whereUsed' service identifies all the parent Item and ItemRevision objects in the structure where the
        input Item or ItemRevision is used. User can provide RevisionRule to search for specific ItemRevision . By
        default all ItemRevision objects are returned. The number of levels of 'whereUsed' search indicates, whether to
        return one or top or all levels of assemblies. It supports 'whereUsed' search on any WorkspaceObject which
        implements the "'whereUsed'" interface.
        
        Use cases:
        A user performs 'whereUsed' search to find all the assemblies that contain a particular Item or ItemRevision.
        User inputs Item or ItemRevision and the search can be made with following options:
        - RevisionRule  This can be set to All, displaying all ItemRevision objects  that have an occurrence of target
        ItemRevision. If a specific RevisionRule is selected only the ItemRevision objects  configured by the rule are
        returned in the search.
        - Depth up to which numbers of levels are to be returned.
        - Boolean representing whether to only send back precise parents (used by ItemRevision specifically and not
        Item)
        
        
        
        Additional Configuration Parameters can be used to do customized whereUsed search. 'WhereUsedConfigParameters'
        has below maps:
        
        stringMap ( std::string, std::string ) 
        doubleMap ( std::string, double ) 
        intMap ( std::string, int ) 
        boolMap ( std::string, bool ) 
        dateMap ( std::string, Teamcenter::DateTime ) 
        tagMap ( std::string, BusinessObjectRef ( Teamcenter::BusinessObject ) ) 
        floatMap ( std::string, float ) 
        
        COTS whereUsed search uses 'tagMap' to specify the RevisionRule with revision_rule as a key, 'boolMap' to
        specify whereUsedPreciseFlag with whereUsedPreciseFlag as a key, and 'intMap' to specify number of levels with
        numLevels as a key. Similarly other maps can be used to pass additional parameters for customized whereUsed
        search. Teamcenter currently don't have any extension where additional Configuration Parameters can be
        considered for 'whereUsed' search if passed by user. User can implement "whereUsed" interface on any custom
        WorkspaceObject to consider additional Configuration Parameters for 'whereUsed' search.
        
        The output contains list of  each parent level search result in the structure.
