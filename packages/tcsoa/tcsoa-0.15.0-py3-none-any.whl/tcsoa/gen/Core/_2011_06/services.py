        server instance. These client applications can be running on the same or different client hosts.
        - Constant     If the user jdoe logs on to Teamcenter using two or more client applications using a constant or
        fixed 'sessionDiscriminator' argument (for example, jdoe/MyApp ), those clients are assigned to the same
        Teamcenter server instance. This is similar to the blank 'sessionDiscriminator' argument; the difference is
        that only multiple instances of the client application using myApp started by jdoe share the same Teamcenter
        server instance.
        - Unique     If the user jdoe logs on using a unique random-generated string (for example, jdoe/akdk938lakc),
        the client application will be assigned to a dedicated instance of the Teamcenter server.
