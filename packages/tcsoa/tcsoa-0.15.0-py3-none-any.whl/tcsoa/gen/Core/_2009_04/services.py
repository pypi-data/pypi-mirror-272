        Start an operation bracket.  An operation bracket is a period of execution in which any object will need to be
        refreshed in the server from the database only once.  This allows the client to avoid unnecessary database
        operations that the server might perform redundantly if underlying code accesses the same object multiple
        times.  The client will use the return value to call the 'stopOperation' operation to indicate the end of the
        bracket.  Brackets may be nested or overlapped.  A bracket should start and end within the scope of a single
        client function and should not span a user interaction.  By default, each service operation starts and stops
        its own operation bracket.
