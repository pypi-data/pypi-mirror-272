        The 'hostPath' argument determines the server machine that the client connects to. Once there, the pool manager

        - Blank     If the user jdoe logs on to Teamcenter using two or more client applications using a blank
        'sessionDiscriminator' argument (for example, jdoe/ ), all of those clients are assigned to the same Teamcenter
        server instance. These client applications can be running on the same or different client hosts.
        - Constant     If the user jdoe logs on to Teamcenter using two or more client applications using a constant or
        fixed 'sessionDiscriminator' argument (for example, jdoe/MyApp ), those clients are assigned to the same
        Teamcenter server instance. This is similar to the blank 'sessionDiscriminator' argument; the difference is
        that only multiple instances of the client application using myApp started by jdoe share the same Teamcenter
        server instance.
        - Unique     If the user jdoe logs on using a unique random generated string (for example, jdoe/akdk938lakc),
        the client application will be assigned to a dedicated instance of the Teamcenter server.

        returned based on how the client application uses those returned business objects. The policy is applied
        uniformly to all service operations. 
        By default, all applications use the Default object property policy, defined on the Teamcenter server
        '$TC_DATA/soa/policies/default.xml.' It is this policy that is applied to all service operation responses until

        'setObjectPRopertyPolicy'. The current policy can be modified with calls to 'updatObjectPropertyPolicy'.
