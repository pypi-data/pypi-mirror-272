# Gianna: Generative Intelligent Artificial Neural Network Assistant

Gianna is a voice assistant that utilizes CrewAI and Langchain to perform complex tasks. It provides an easy way to create chain instances for working with a simple prompt, a string parser, and various LLM models such as OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA, Groq, and Ollama.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)

```shell
sudo apt update -y 
```

```shell
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends -y \
   build-essential \
   libpq-dev \
   libgirepository1.0-dev \
   libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev \
   python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev \
   libportaudio2
```

```shell
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
