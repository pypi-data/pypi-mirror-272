## Quick Tour
### Setting up
```py
from raga_llm_eval import RagaLLMEval, get_data

# Initialize with API key
evaluator = RagaLLMEval(api_keys={"OPENAI_API_KEY": "xxx"})
```

###  List available
```py
# List available tests
evaluator.list_available_tests()
```

### Adding and Running Tests
#### Using Custom Data
```py
# Add tests with custom data
evaluator.add_test(
    test_names=["relevancy_test", "summarisation_test"],
    data={
        "prompt": ["How are you?", "How do you do?"],
        "context": ["You are a student, answering your teacher."],
        "response": ["I am fine. Thank you", "Doooo do do do doooo..."],
    },
    arguments={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "threshold": 0.6},
).run()

evaluator.print_results()

```

#### Using Provided Test Data
```py
# Add tests with provided test data
evaluator.add_test(
    test_names=["relevancy_test"],
    data=get_data("relevancy_test", num_samples=1),
    arguments={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "threshold": 0.6},
).run()

evaluator.print_results()
```

## Advanced Usage: Piping and Saving Results
The `raga_llm_eval` package supports a fluent interface, allowing you to chain methods together using a piping style. This approach can make your code more readable and concise. Additionally, you can save the evaluation results to a JSON file for further analysis or record-keeping. Below are examples demonstrating these capabilities.

### Piping Method Calls
Piping allows you to chain multiple operations in a single statement. This can simplify your code, making it easier to read and maintain. Here's an example of how to use piping to add a test, run it, and print the results:

```python
# Method piping
evaluator.add_test(
    test_names=["relevancy_test", "summarisation_test"],
    data={
        "prompt": ["What is the capital of France?", "Explain quantum entanglement."],
        "context": ["You are a geography teacher.", "You are a physics professor explaining to a student."],
        "response": ["The capital of France is Paris.", "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected..."],
    },
    arguments={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "threshold": 0.75},
).run()

evaluator.print_results()
```

### Saving Results to a File
```python
# Adding a test, running it, printing, and saving the results to a JSON file
evaluator.add_test(
    test_names=["relevancy_test", "summarisation_test"],
    data={
        "prompt": ["What is the capital of France?", "Explain quantum entanglement."],
        "context": ["You are a geography teacher.", "You are a physics professor explaining to a student."],
        "response": ["The capital of France is Paris.", "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected..."],
    },
    arguments={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "threshold": 0.75},
).run()

evaluator.print_results()

```
This will execute the tests, print the results to the console, and also save the results in a file named `evaluation_results.json` in your current working directory.

Explore these capabilities to get the most out of your language model evaluations with `raga-llm-eval`.

Happy Evaluating!

## Tests Supported

## Relevance & Understanding
In this suite of tests, we focus on the model's ability to provide relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses. This includes evaluating the model's precision, recall, and overall understanding of the given context to generate relevant answers.

1. **Relevancy Test**: Measures the relevance of LLM response to the input prompt

2. **Contextual Precision Test**: Evaluates if relevant nodes in context are ranked higher, resulting in a dictionary with precision score, reason, and details. Higher scores indicate more precise context alignment.

3. **Contextual Recall Test**: Measures alignment of retrieval context with expected response, outputting a dictionary with recall score, reason, and details. Higher scores denote better recall.

4. **Contextual Relevancy Test**: Assesses the overall relevance of context to the input prompt, providing a dictionary with relevancy score, reason, and details. Higher scores mean more relevant context.

5. **Hallucination Test**: Determines the hallucination score of the model's response compared to the context, offering a dictionary with scores and details. Higher scores indicate more hallucinated responses.

6. **Faithfulness Test**: Evaluates if the LLM response aligns with the retrieval context, producing a dictionary with a faithfulness score and details. Higher scores suggest more faithful responses.

7. **Consistency Test**: Provides a score for the consistency of responses, with a dictionary containing scores and evaluation details. Higher scores indicate better consistency.

8. **Conciseness Test**: Checks the conciseness of the LLM response, yielding a dictionary with a conciseness score and related information. Higher scores denote more concise responses.

9. **Coherence Test**: Assesses the coherence of the LLM response, resulting in a dictionary with coherence scores and details. Higher scores suggest more coherent responses.
