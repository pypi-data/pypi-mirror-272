**This is a temporary fork of the original YLS repository (avast/yls) in order to allow an easy installation of all components on macOS ARM devices.**

This repository only includes changes that allow publishing this python module under a different name - `yls-macos-arm` - as well as including `yari-py-macos-arm` as a dependency instead of the default `yari-py` module. There are no changes to the code itself.

**This repository is not managed by Avast. If you have issues, please report them upstream.**
