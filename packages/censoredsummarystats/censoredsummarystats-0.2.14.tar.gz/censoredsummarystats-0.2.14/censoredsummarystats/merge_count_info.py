'''
The function in this module support the ability to merge count information
to stat tables. Required information includes (i) a CensoredData input object
that contains the original data table, (ii) a DataFrame that contains the
final stat outputs, (iii) the specific column groupings used to combine data,
and (iv) the names to give the count for each grouping.
