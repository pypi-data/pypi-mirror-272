user: You have been accused of sockpuppetry at <url>.  Scared?
"user: If you're going to accuse me of operating in bad faith, then the discussion has become inappropriately personal.  On what grounds do you make such an implication?"
"user: Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you?"
"user: May I ask why you removed <url> from the article on <url>?  Since CAP is the USAF's official auxiliary, wouldn't it make sense for the CAP article to be in the USAF category?"
"user: Makes me wanna ask, what do you say about having separate articles like Wikipedia has <url> and <url> or <url> and <url>? Should this be tolerated for non-Transformers stuff?"
user: I have some made some improvements to the articles you references on the above user's talk page. Perhaps next time you would bring your concerns directly to '''me'''?
"user: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?"
"user: Dana, before I give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing, I need to know if <url> is still gonna work on the problems. Do you get me?"
"user: I have no need to search the interwebs, all that matters is it offends people and is a violation of NPOV and MoS. ""All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources)"" - ess-eff is a bias term for a minority group of fans, put it this way: is there an SF-channel, or how often is the clichxe9 ess-eff used outside fan-groups?"
"user: (after multipled edit conflicts)I checked your behaviour and your contributions myself at the time, as did numerous other admins who reviewed your edits and the block and it was subject of extensive discussion on and off-site so your suggestion that I should have checked with others is silly. You violated Wikipedia's policies and were blocked rightly for it; you've been given a second chance and instead of being productive you come here to moan about a comment I made more than six months ago, that I still stand by, and to pursue your now year-old vendetta against Nick?"
user: you have been following me around all week reverting my edits.  what did i do to you?
"user: I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn't <url> have specific requirements for this?"
"user: I kind of agree.  Are you planning on actually editing Wikipedia, or is your whole purpose here to promote this ... study (or whatever it is)?"
"user: Hey, if you want to assert that a cite does not say what it clearly does say, how about actually coming to the discussion page to discuss it, rather than treating edit summaries like a discussion space?  Why the hell am I the one being accused of edit warring, when I'm the only one actually willing to talk on the discussion page?"
"user: What is unreliable about the newspaper article reports about the protests in Meliti, Lofi, etc? Are you alleging that the protests against the Greek military did not occur?"
"user: So do I, because, inspite of my 100s of friends and supporters, I'm feeling a little beleaguered and lonely here. If I can hang on in here, can't you at least keep me company?"
user: The only way I have a naval website is that I am one of the people actively working to make sure Wikipedia has good coverage of naval topics here. Which website do you think I run?
"user: I see that you closed that CfD discussion as rename, but haven't actually renamed the categories. What's up with that?"
"user: How about Guant who plays Pansy? Or Richard Fish who played Bill Weasley, and the actor who played Charlie Weasley in POA?"
"user: And DAB uses a very foul language, persistently, is that right? Did I not talk to you about that already?"
user: I'm sorry but looking back on that edit I won't stand for that. Don't you think that actually removing the edit summary was a bit... well... let's say 'abusing sysop powers'?
user: I was not trying to sound rude earlier. Haunted Angel which of my seven reasons had you decided were evidence of his sock puppetry?
"user: One question - how come the page is marked as ""in dispute""?  The data that is currently posted isn't in dispute, correct?"
user: Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects?
user: Further: it seems to me that <url> was a perfectly reasonable dab page. I wonder why you needed to change it?
"user: Email from the Darkshado guy complaining about you adding him to the spamlist. I searched the site and couldn't find any of our articles replicated there; has he removed them, or what?"
"user: I'm sure. How about we let the sockpuppet investigation let us know for certain, m'kay?"
user: COI? What COI do you think I have?
user: and so is the new Portishead. Did I mention the Knife?
"user: I've noticed that you're engaged in several edit wars, with Meliniki, regarding minor alterations to multiple Greek language articles. Perhaps you should consider discussing the changes on Meliniki's <url> instead?"
user: Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?
"user: ED... They have drugs to fix that now, don't they?"
"user: Eh? No, those facts were correct, why do you think they were not?"
"user: What do you mean by ""one edit war away""? And whats a siteban?"
"user: Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn't the article's title ""Austria<span style=""color:red"">u2013</span>Hungary"" (where, incidentally, it was moved after an ""Austria<span style=""color:red"">-</span>Hungary"" period)? It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?"
"user: Well, now you've got me puzzled. If you think he's a sneaky vandal, why did you revert my reversion of his numerical change?"
"user: Why can't you just remove the offending phase and repost your comment?  This resolves the situation, does it not?"
"user: Alright, the NPOV template is even worse, since it specifically points people to a talk page discussion which does not exist. Why are you adding these templates?"
user: On the third reading... Why not include an edit summary that tells me this? Why not revert my revert?
"user: Your obfuscation of the real issue is disengenuous; I'm rapidly losing respect for you. Is it not Wikipedia's mission to scornfully snub vandalism, which is done instantly, agressively, mercilessly?"
"user: What part of ""use common sense"" did not get through to you? Was it the ""use,"" the ""common,"" the ""sense,"" or some combination thereafter?"
user: Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change?  And do you really think the RfC expressed consensus support for such a position?
user: No kidding.  Perhaps you could be troubled to point out the parts you consider to be actionable as 'spam'?
user: Such as the redundant link to ''Roe v. Wade''? Not an improvement?
"user: SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23?"
"user: It's placed outside of the article body, not ""randomly put in the code"". Why such shuffling is a ""proper CHECKWIKKI task"" and why does it warrant saving an edit?"
"user: You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton.  Why did you do it?"
"user: The policy is quite clear; userids set up for the purposes of harassment or vandalism are blocked indefinitely.  That said, what policy is it that you think I'm not following?"
"user: If someone is an immigrant and not legally documented, that someone is an illegal immigrant.  How can such a rally be anything but pro-illegal-immigration?"
"user: This is what you wrote: ""In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times."" What book, 1948??"
user: If you completely disagree then why havn't you required references on other airport pages??
user: So how come he can have all types of slandereous links on his wiki page? Don't you think being an admin you should delete them?
user: Why is your AWB robot changing '''&amp;Oslash;''' to the letter '''xd8'''? I asked you if all computers in the World are set up to read &Oslash; ?
"user: Yeeesh. Is it just me, or is it very difficult to follow these ""stream of consciousness"" postings?"
user: What City in Connecticut do you live in? And have you been to the north as your name suggests?
"user: Evidently, I don't have enough consciousness, because I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about. Could you tell me?"
"user: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?"
"user: Im interested in where you got the information you added stating woodlands house was closed in 2003. As far as i can see your wording was taken from one website, the milesfaster one. Should you not cite the website you quoted rather than look for a couple of others?"
user: Why would one want to re-create GNAA??
user: Hi. With only a little over one day remaiming and <url> not editing and not contributing to the case as yet are there to be any known deviations from the standard procedure?
user: Eight more articles semi-protected. How many of these damned T & J articles are there?
user: I couldn't tell you why glam rock was there. Better?
"user: Ack, hit the wrong button?  How do you manage that?"
user: How can people edit them if it just redirects? Did you think about that?
"user: I'm wondering why in the <url> article, you keep changing the link <url> to <url> which just redirects to <url>?  Why not just leave the link to point to the intended article directy?"
user: Why isn't <url> included there? Is it possible there's a redirect in it's place?
"user: I saw you removed the copyright CSD from Universum University as being ""unclear copyright status"".  What am I missing?"
user: See <url>. I assume you didn't mean <url> ?
user: Um... the Kent roast? Tentrake host?
user: Personal attacks and refusing to answer questions. What are you hiding?
"user: Hi, sorry I think I'm missing something here. Why are you adding a red link to the vandalism page?"
user: I don't understand why did you add that message at the bottom of this page??
"user: Third: it's August 31 2010. Please check my userpage for reasons why I really don't feel useful today. Ask another admin, okay?"
"user: I really would rather use, in English, the one expression ""<url>"" instead of ""<url>,"" ""marz,"" ""<url>,"" ""khaet,"" ""<url>,"" ""eparchia,"" ""ostan,"" ""khoueng,"" ""faritany,"" ""aimag,"" ""tinh""u2014or ""<url>"" (aka ""<url>"").  <url> then why should ""<url>"" not be also?"
"user: I'm not sure how I feel about you adding coordinates to locations all over the place, but rather than get into that, let's start with something easy: ""<url>"" does not equal ""<url>"". Do you need me to explain why, or was that just a typo?"
"user: Right, so the links on your userpage? And what is the ""article"" you want me to check over?"
"user: Well it looked as though it had stopped, certainly tapered off for a few days but now some bloody wanker has started adding it again. I don't suppose you know how to get a page protected, I've never had to do it before?"
"user: Fair enough on the general murder victims. But Kriss Donald was British, was he not?"
user: Why do you ask me questions to which you already know the answers? Is it a rhetorical device?
"user: In case you didn't realize, one of the first things they states on that article was that if the information on a main or major character becomes long, then it warrants its own article. So, if that the case, then why did you merge <url>, since his article is long and he is the main character on <url>?"
"user: So, let me make sure I understand this. You think that, if we remove an image as it does not meet the NFCC, you would then be able to upload the same image, only this time, it would meet the NFCC?"
"user: Ah well, if you are going to have such a bizarre flight of fancy as far as to calling it an attack page then perhaps I will remove it. Maybe you should also look at how you interact with others?"
"user: Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references.  Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada?"
"user: ''Don't'' talk ''about'' me, in my virtual presence, and tell someone else to ignore me. Do you understand why this behavior is inappropriate?"
user: Drat forgot to sign.  You blanked my talk page and asked if I don't like K's?
"user: Having said that, I don't want to drive anyone away just because they can't write well. The question is, where do you begin?"
"user: Just FYI, I have decided to be <url> and remove the screenshot at the top of the article.  There is already a link to a mirror of goatse.cx in external links, so why force readers to look at that?"
user: Your early edit's clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this?
user: Links to attack sites and so are not allowed. You must know that you violated BLP?
"user: Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non-notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over-the-top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of ""credible notability""?"
user: Because Wikipedia is an encylopaedia not a free advertising and self promotion venue. Why do you keep abusing it?
"user: Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?"
"user: Please explain why you continue to <url> <url> <url> over the folk magic/Christian revivalist wording in the lede despite the clear consensus against you.  You have not gained any favorable comments for your position in the RFC (which in fact is about the treasure seeking sentence you want to add and not about rewording or removing the existing sentence), so on what basis do you claim preeminence for your preferred wording, or for removing the sentences completely?"
"user: The flag ""visible=yes"" means a comment on the page is made visible, not that the page is visible in search engines. Why did you remove flag?"
user: Just move <url> to <url>. And shouldn't the clean-up parameter be added to <url> also to make it work?
"user: Umm... isn't the template page itself semi-protected? If so, then shouldn't it be in the category?"
"user: Wait a minute! I've done plenty of good edits, where did they all go?"
user: Sorry Less? What is that last postdirected at?
user: How many times do I have to revert you before you stop? Do you want to get blocked?
user: Based on what? Don't you think a little discussion is in order before doing this?
"user: I advance (Ultra-Orthodox) Rabbi Dr Mordechai Halperin, (Ultra-Orthodox), Rabbi Gershon Winkler, (Conservative) Rabbi Elliot Dorff, to you, for example, that the Torah and Talmud only forbids anal sex. Now explain exactly what division of Judaism is left, for you to claim your view fairly represents?"
"user: You reverted my removal of the ""to critical acclaim"" description from this article. I cannot see where in <url> there is a basis for that claim -  it looks like a neutral factual review to me?"
"user: Maybe others haven't noticed - or are too busy.  If you are thinking what I'm thinking, why am I reverting so many of your edits?"
user: When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it?
"user: I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn't you ask me this before?"
"user: One more thing, you have a fellow Budgie insisting a losing appearance in an FA Cup semi is an ""Honour"" for your club.  I guess it's because you haven't won much lately, but really, a losing semi-finalist isn't an honour in the real sense of the word, is it?"
user: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?
user: I don't see any of that in his deletion log.  Would you please find out which one it was as evidence so you're not blindly accusing an admin of deleting something they didn't delete?
"user: I know, I looked it up and fixed the article, but it was annoying that you just changed one small thing making the page contradict itself. What's the use changing it if the reader will have no idea what's going on?"
"user: So your argument is that as long as you follow the ""rules,"" nothing else should matter? That if it's legal it's OK?"
"user: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to ""encourage"" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the ""mocking"" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?"
user: OK done. When do I get my money?
"user: The article is not about this, at all. Could you explain your logic?"
user: In this <url> there was a loss of some info.  Was that intentional?
user: Your new images of Micheal Knight and Devon look kinda squashed. Can you fix them or find better ones to replace them?
user: I'm curious as to why you chose to <url> a full two minutes after my last comment?  Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue?
user: I believe supserstition exists.  Why did you ask me?
"user: Comply with what your talk page says, get off and study!!!! Have you willpower?"
user: I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it's purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?
user: Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I'll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit?
user: (S)he seems to have violated the spirit of 3RR <url>. How do we deal with this guy?
user: I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?
"user: Self-follow-up: Also, while sometimes the status quo should be maintained, by supporting it in this case, you're also supporting a ""revert-first, ask questions later"" approach to dealing with good faith edits. Is that really what you want?"
user: What page is this? Why was it deleted?
"user: Just to let you know, there's a <url> now. I don't know, is this mimicry allowed on Wikipedia?"
user: Where did you learn English? How come you're taking on a third language?
user: PS - surprised you didn't make the annoucement in your blog.  Trying to fool your hordes of devoted readers?
"user: Wow, you waited a whole ten minutes. What's the problem?"
user: Why on earth have you deleted the article on the <url>?  Can you please undelete it?
"user: Since your last warning to BigBang19, he's continued to vandalize the ''Punk'd'' article, undoing the grammatical corrections I made some time ago, and inserting irrelevant, non-noteworthy material about Kuthcer's observence of Jewish holidays and his marriage to Demi Moore.  Can someone block this person for a period of more than just 24 hours so that he gets the message?"
user: I asked it before but I'm asking it again: Was it a Basque state? Can we say that?
"user: Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation?"
"user: Actually, I counted 2 sets of <url>.  Can he be blocked for 48 hours?"
user: Oh and you seem to have deleted half of the stuff on <url> ... I presume this was a mistake?
"user: And if you use Coulson you would probably have to say ""According to Coulson..."". Have you read <url> yet?"
"user: Since I have not been able to get an answer to this on the project page, let me ask you directly: Did you receive Durova's ""secret evidence"" prior to the blocking of <url>?"
"user: BTW, I'm amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term?"
user: You see how time consuming and annoying it is when a person keeps on telling you to provide a source. Why do you want ''Michael'' to be just another compilation album?
"user: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?"
"user: I will say this, though, in the form of a suggestion: it makes me a bit uneasy to see you so involved and sometimes argumentative in your nomination. Why not step back and let the community do its thing?"
user: What for did you analyse the two ArbCom cases Piotrus-Ghirla and Eastern European dispute? Was that suggested to you by Sciurinxe6 during your off-wiki discussions for 20 days?
"user: Reading your help desk comment, I'm totally confused now. Was it 2005 or 2006?"
"user: Now I'm confused--did I miss something? Who was talking about G1, and who was talking about IP blocks?"
"user: Isn't this section ""Vatican Responses""? How come the wordings are not fact-based but seem to have devolved into media perceptions of the Vatican responses?"
"user: No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this?"
user: Could you please clarify who the new users were exactly that you considered to be part of your 'sock farm'?  Or did you not even bother to research before making such claims?
user: You said other sources supported the info in the infobox yet you did not indicate what sources. And why can't we use a primary source for his birth date?
"user: Hi. The original link (http://www.lgso.org.uk/index.htm) gives a 404 error, but the amended URL (http://www.lgso.org.uk/) works for me, so why do you say it's still dead?"
"user: Let me know what you'd like me to do. Are you/anyone thinking of copying over the temporary copy wholesale or in parts; destroying the edit history of either, both or neither..?"
"user: Yesterday you undid an edit of mine (on the <url> article). What did you mean by ""a COI link""?"
"user: Well, look again! Does ''<url>'' look like a dictionary-definition page to you?"
"user: Hey, can you block this moron from editing the IIHF Page? Or what can i do in such cases?"
user: I replied to you <url> but you didn't answer. Did you not see it?
"user: I certainly think more things should be deleted from enwiki, but TheCommunity(tm) is fickle. Are you complaining about something ''I'' did?"
"user: SudoGhost, just a question. Do you think that simply calling someone's edits disruptive is very specific?"
"user: And I guess with exception of 7 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, everybody else would end up in ""homophobia"" category. Or what would be the threshold?"
user: Wassat? LeaveVissToYou?
"user: I thought that, when some informations are mentioned about in ''desperate housewives'', it is a reliable source? So, in your way of thinking, Susan Mayer maiden name is not Bremmer or something like that?"
user: You also seem somedeal similar to <url>. Not logging in is not sockpuppetry but do you acknowledge that User:64.194.44.220 is you?
"user: OK, I'll bite. How is ''Matt ""Dirty"" Sanchez'' to be construed as anything other than a personal attack?"
user: Depends; do you care deeply about image policy? Or are you an incurable masochist?
"user: Thanks, but I believe I've covered the sustance. Could you also get Beeblebrox to strike the ""Mr"" insult, unless he was doing it deliberately?"
"user: What's your issue with noting the copyright registration date for this piece?  Also, could you point me to the consensus you mentioned?"
user: This is irritating. What browser are you using?
user: How can you possibly know that? Have you tried to find additional content and failed to find it?
user: Are you saying you have never edited as anything else? What brought you to that particular article?
