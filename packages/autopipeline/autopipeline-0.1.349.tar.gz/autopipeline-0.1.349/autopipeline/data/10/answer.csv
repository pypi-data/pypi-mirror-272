"&gt;Dr.[Scott <ORG>]([url] <ORG> on Monday he expects rising U.S. coronavirus cases, linked to the highly transmissible delta variant, to start declining in the next two to three weeks, pointing to the U.K.s fall in infections as evidence for what may play out in America."
"Once we have enough vaccinated people masking will end. <SEP> And it will be safe again, too."
And if Delta infections go down like some are predicting...shouldn't be the case very for very long.
I dont see anything good about this current time period.
"Perhaps this is an indication that the prediction of the Delta Variant being a quick burn and then a crasher might be true, particularly in Arkansas' case. <SEP> Once again, too early to say, but an observation."
"I do hope a Delta variant booster shot is administered this Fall, so I feel safer. <SEP> Cases are surprisingly going up again now because the general public is stupid and the CDC failed with mask guidelines."
Does anybody out there have any sort of reliable information about how likely it is it a person will get a breakthrough infection if theyre fully vaccinated with two doses of <ORG>?
"I've started seeing a therapist about this, and other things, and I'm set to see a hematologist at the end of August, but I'm still without a second dose and gripped with fear that I'll catch the delta variant and that it will hospitalize me or worse."
If he wasnt vaccinated he more than likely wouldnt have made it.
"I legit left my home state for a summer internship right when things seemed to be getting better again, so being able to spend time with friends when it was safer to do so was impossible for me (Ive only planned one get-together with a friend since March 2020, and even that was nearly a bust because of how difficult it was to plan a masked/socially distanced outdoor get-together), and I had been looking forward to seeing them again once I returned in August."
Given how the media said that covid-19 (Delta variant) is more contagious than chickenpox I feel it is only a matter of time before it becomes as contagious as measles.
"I feel like no one is safe anymore, regardless of age or health conditions."
I can't see how this will ever end.
"Im not saying were going to, but Im scared of the possibility."
"So guys, as bad as this looks, we are still at the tail."
I know were practically at the end but just need to know *how close.
I'm just scared because I know the second shot is supposed to be worse.
I just don't want to feel awful and be an anxious wreck the whole time.
"Part of me feels like Im still vulnerable to getting serious sick, especially with breakthrough cases."
"I know if I get COVID, itll be mild (Im young, healthy, and vaccinated)."
"I am starting to feel this sensation of impending doom, almost waiting for the other shoe to drop and enter a fourth wave."
"While this may be true, I still feel like this can just be a scare tactic click-bait scam."
Will see total dose #'s rise as 1st dose increases started ~4 wks ago.
I don't want to miss work and I need the money desperately or I won't be able to pay my bills this month...
What should i do?
Does anyone have any input on if this is relatively safe or a bad idea?
What's the latest advice?
"Could it be too early to detect the virus in her? <SEP> (She's vaccinated, but did say that her meds make her immunocompromised). <SEP> I have been going to workout classes... Am I still safe to go?"
Will there be long term effects from the vaccine?
"According to their guidelines, neither of those numbers meets the requirement for substantial or high transmission. <SEP> Is there something screwed up with the map, or am I just not understanding it?"
Anyone else taking extra precautions for the time being until cases go down ?
"I know there are lots of people who don't want the vaccine for many reasons, but is this persons argument of minimal long term data on how it might affect someone in later life even valid?"
"I know most reports say the vaccines are effective for at least six months, but what about after?"
Any tips or help?
Is it worth the risk to work with the public when I don't absolutely need to?
"Is it normal? <SEP> Most cases I see in reddit comments are like ""I had no fever after day one"" ""I was 100% after day 2"" and here I am with fever, sore arm and a headache on day 3."
"Even with Delta, vaccinations are increasing and hopefully if Delta falls we wont have to worry so much about future surges."
Yes it will.
"I know vaccines don't make you 100% immune from the disease, but I thought initial studies had shown that the mRNA vaccines were extremely effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death (I almost want to say that initial studies suggested 100% protection from serious cases, but I could be remembering incorrectly)."
"As long as we got the vaccines, someday will end this pandemic. <SEP> And who knows? <SEP> Maybe if FDA approved the official covid vaccines maybe this month or next month, maybe there's a chance that pandemic will end maybe this year or the early next year."
"My friend who wore the KN95 is very sick, and while we're still waiting on the test he probably has COVID given the severity + the fact he already had a cold this month."
"I still want to get a test before being around my family, just to be safe. <SEP> Do I still need to wait the 72 hours, or is 48 hours enough in my situation?"
Im currently on Cephalexin(Kflex) for Cellulitis I was wondering is it okay if i get the vaccine now or should I wait till Im done with the antibiotics and get it on Friday?
"Plus, if the FDA approves the vaccine boosters, doe this make people who refused to get vaccinated are interested to be vaccinated?"
My state and city are a current Delta hot-spot and I don't see it getting much better in the near future.
Some days I feel like I really want to go and will be fine and other days I'm absolutely terrified at even the thought.
"Hi all, I hope this doesnt cause a pile or get deleted but Im not sure where to write this as I know that antivaxx pages will call me an idiot for wanting it and will probably push me further into not wanting it (which is where I really dont want to be)."
"I've heard all sorts of side effects from the vaccine, like myocarditis and pericarditis, blood clots, heavier menstruation, and it all just really scares me."
"Here are a few things you can do right now to help yourself. <SEP> If you aren't working, start applying for work. <SEP> There are a lot of businesses hiring, and a lot of competition right now."
"Are my fears/stresses justified? <SEP> Or Do you think It'll be fine, and I should just try to think about the present? <SEP> Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry if I sound so paranoid."
Morbidly obese but fully vaccinated.
"It's enough to make me question whether it is time to stop being hopelessly optimistic and adopt being realistic that we are never, ever going to end the pandemic this year or the next and that we're stuck in for years to come."
And I'm scared of some of the things I liked to go to just collapsing from lack of funds and never coming back
"But seems a little excessive for me, and I hadn't heard this from other sources."
I see articles of how the vaccines arent working and how this will go on for several more years.
"Now it is down to 1.28. <SEP> If it continues to fall and given how highly vaxxed the state is, I doubt we will see much of a surge here at that time, if at all."
"Delta is scary, but had we all not been vaccinated this would have likely been so much worse."
"Hello, I realize that this question is automatically going to piss a lot of people off."
"Im a little worried about my dads reaction if I cancel; hes very anti-vaccine and we have avoided really talking about this so far, though I did see him earlier in the summer when delta wasnt so much of a threat."
I want to say that this is a good thing because cases are rising (and vaccines are being mandated in more and more places and sectors which is definitely good) but I can't help but get the feeling things are just going to stagnate or get worse for another year here.
what harm would there be in getting a first dose of moderna at a different pharmacy?
After two weeks i have some discomfort behind the ears and stiff neck with small brain fog. <SEP> Any help or someone with similar side effects?
"I'm hopeful that by the end of the Delta wave in the U.S., enough people will have been inoculated one way or another to prevent another widespread surge. <SEP> At this point I guess I'm only trying to reassure myself. <SEP> I'd like to know, though, if there's a flaw in my evaluation of our current situation?"
Is there no end in sight to this Delta wave?
"I'm fully vaccinated, mostly stay in my house, I am 100% positive this is just asthma, but no reason to take chances with other people's health."
I got the vaccine so I could return to my pre pandemic life but now it seems like the vaccine won't even get us out of it and that I should be careful again.
"Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US."
"My anxiety about that has evaporated, but now Im hyper focused on the possibility that I was exposed to COVID while I was there."
I got a negative rapid test after having two weeks of symptoms and she said that the doctor still ordered a PCR test as well even though she said they don't normally do them for that scenario.
"I say this to remind people that while these statistics are reassuring, it's not a reason to get rid of all restrictions."
However now delta has broken through and it is likely that we are about to experience what most of the rest of the world has already lived through - a major covid wave.
"I care for my elderly mom(adore the lady), we are both fully vac, but it makes you wonder if we are going to have another crush in a few months to scramble to get the booster."
It feels like well just have this never ending wave until after the holidays.
"Im convinced at this point that this is never going to end, and were trapped in an endless cycle of waves and mask mandates and boosters and nonstop, obsessive news coverage about case counts, to the point that you cant even ignore it if you want to because its everywhere and all anyone talks about."
"Im so over having any amount of hope anymore, since I know Ill just get my hopes up, and Im not even looking forward to going back to college this weekend since I feel like things will just be bad again with this variant for who knows how long (even as someone who is young, doesnt have pre-existing conditions, and is fully vaccinated)."
"Obviously this puts her and my other coworkers at risk of catching the virus, but I feel like I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't make an effort to talk to her."
We're always slow to open up so even when things are relatively good we get less time to enjoy it than others and end up even further behind in my career.
"We may not know when will this pandemic ends right now, but maybe if the FDA approves more vaccines for kids under 12 this month or the next, then maybe we'll get back to normalcy either later this year or early next year."
I'll wear ffp2 mask and I can eat the breakfast in my hotel room (the hotel offers some kind of breakfast bags that you can pick up from the hotel reception).
"I read so many terrible stories...I'm hoping if I ask real, everyday people who have gotten it what it was like, particularly breakthroughs, maybe the breakthrough cases won't sound as scary?"
I just dont see an end in sight to the increases in cases and it seems like even next year this pandemic will still be quite severe.
"Hi All, My office is requiring mandatory work in office starting next week for two days a week."
"As grim as that sounds that a 5th wave could be coming, the good news is that I can promise it will end in mid 2022."
Cold weather is just around the corner meaning more and more to come I would imagine.
"I'm feeling like it's probably time to get vaccinated despite my previous infection, but I'm really curious to see how much higher vaccine-level antibodies are than my current levels."
The FDA may set the approval of the <ORG> vaccines this Monday: [[url] I hope this will make everybody get vaccinated this time to end this horrible pandemic.
I have the green light to return to work but I'm freaking myself out that I might be a danger to others.
"It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid."
"I need the vaccine because I smoke, am overweight, and have asthma."
Cause im dreading the moment ive got to take a booster and honestly I don't think its gonna change anthing now
"The transmission rate among the rooms occupants wouldn't be any lower just because half of them are vaccinated, in fact the only thing that would be lower is the number of severe cases and hospitalisations."
My dad would not survive a COVID infection.
lets all work together and achieve the World health organizations goal of 70% vaccination worldwide by mid 2022!
So these are Saturdays numbers and remember Saturday and Sunday are always going to be smaller than most of the other dates.
"I had my friend over and we stayed like 25 feet apart outdoors, I had thought she had left and went out my garage and she was right there and in my face like close close for like 15 seconds."
We all wear masks but Im wondering how many people are walking around thinking they have allergies when its covid.
I understand covid is now endemic and will be around for a long time...
"If this were right, kids would literally have to endure half the 2021-2022 school year without a vaccine :("
I'm sure we will get it sometime next week.
I'll likely move out tomorrow and isolate for 2 weeks.
"Considering playing with a mask, but leaning away from it with the increase Delta risk."
I think most likely whatever I have now is from the gym and not taking proper rest because Im working full time now.
And then fauci is saying maybe spring 2022 assuming we get enough people vaccinated and I'm not too hopeful on that especially considering many red states banned vaccine passports.
"They wouldn't listen. <SEP> Since I don't leave the house much, I figured it would be okay to give up. <SEP> I agreed to wait until FDA approval, then get it."
We can/will go higher!
"He did get tested and it turned out positive, which means that I have most likely caught it as well."
"PR has been linked to COVID in studies, but of course there's no way to know as it's a pretty common rash."
"I know I can get a proof of recovery from a doctor or public health official, but Im not really sure how simple that would be for an American in the UK?"
"However, last night at the end of the date, he wanted to kiss, and while I said no due to having to social distance, it prompted me to think...what would the future of us dating look like?"
"More vaccinated people means more breakthrough cases, so hearing that a state like Oregon or Massachusetts is experiencing more breakthrough cases shouldn't concern anyone or leave people thinking that the vaccine is ineffective."
I was vaccinated with <ORG> in March so by the time October rolls around the efficacy will be wearing off.
I could be positive because of being in contact with a positive case and I'm currently isolating until Sept 1 as required/will be tested.
"From what I can gather, my exposure seems relatively low because even if my girlfriend's risk is high, I saw her around 24 hours after her exposure."
I had lunch with a friend yesterday and I think it would devastate me if I got her sick.
I want to know what is the best test to get to test.
"If things are bad even in highly vaccinated countries because of waning, it seems guaranteed that even something close 2019 levels of normalcy isn't attainable."
"Hi, Now that since FDA approve <ORG> vaccine and I've heard that for those of the people that refused to get vaccinated are interested getting vaccinated this time. <SEP> So, does this mean that since the FDA approved <ORG> Vaccine and <ORG> coming soon, will make the people refused to get vaccinated now to get vaccinated this time?"
"Even more so that I'm 32m, autistic, and still live with my mother, who is *incredibly* overbearing to me and had been for my entire life, and therefore overreacts to every little thing I say or do in the house, including the possibility of spreading germs."
"So Im afraid of us once again not thinking about it too much for now only to find out in a few months that its serious On a related note, theres also been [rnews of a B.1.621 variant]([url] as well as [news of a B.1.621 variant]([url] as well as [news of Delta mutating rapidly]([url] Like C.1.2, Im afraid B.1.621 and potential variants from Deltas rapid mutation all lead to variants that we are told not to worry about for now, only for it to blow up in a few months and set us back again."
"When I found out they both had it, I decided to stay in my room, upstairs, because I was in a position to do so and I really didn't want to take any risks."
I heard that boosters are likely to be given to older people in January '22 that means after Christmas.
"Be kind, getting vaccinated was difficult for me and waiting to get the second dose which tends to cause more symptoms and potential for serious side effects to appear is nerveracking"
Which makes me feel like he might try to attend regardless.
"So while the last 16 months have um, kept me on my toes, I find myself more and more daydreaming about what my job might be like post-pandemic."
I am also still hopeful that vaccinated folks spread less.
this has really freaked me out about working during the pandemic i cant commit to applying anywhere because im terrified ill get covid or worse bring it to my family.
My lungs cant handle COVId due to the treatments I received and at the same time Im not sure I can handle more of what I experienced after first dose.
"(Also, I live in a college town and my school is requiring all students to get tested at the beginning of the semester, which I think is a nice safety precaution and I'm also very excited to see the data results from this.)"
"It's so liberating and it feels so good, and I feel like Delta is so contagious that normal surgical masks probably wouldn't prevent infection anyway even if we were all 100% diligent."
"Friday (5 days from Monday) seems like the optimal time to test but I'm afraid that the weekend, particularly the holiday weekend, will muck things up with either getting the sample there on time or just by delaying our results."
I really don't want to catch a virus that affects my breathing as it would trigger panic attacks for me.
"Hi, I don't think we'll never get that Delta Variant under control!"
"If this variant goes wide, I dont think I can handle it emotionally."
"I have an anxiety disorder and asthsma, and I'm convinced I'm going to die."
"Hi, I just hope this pandemic ends in the new year, so hang out with my friends, go to the movies, go to Disneyland, go see a musical theatre, and do a simmer musical next year."
"Hey everyone, I think I need to take a couple of days away from Reddit as a whole, and this particular sub Reddit in particular to get my head back on straight and to stop worrying so much."
But even then I dont feel like Ill be able to make any new friends.
We currently dont have my 2 year old son in daycare due to children catching it.
"Our dad died of covid in February and a couple of weeks ago her ex partner, my nieces dad killed himself."
On Friday I received some papers from someone who tested positive for COVID about a day or two ago.
"To put that into perspective, you have a better chance of getting dealt four of a kind in poker than that (1 in 4165)."
"Come to think of it, I don't personally know anyone who was admitted overnight for covid and came back."
"What exactly will solve this, and what exactly will end it? <SEP> Im starting to rapidly lose hope very quickly and I can barely even take care of myself at this point I feel so depressed."
Right now I feel like my life is never gonna get better because of covid and the economic effects.
I think there will still be more people coming in for vaccinations this week.
The rest of the family is negative and symptom free (so far) so she's going to be fairly isolated.
"However, with cases on the rise, what can we do to get cases back down?"
If it doesn't clear up in a couple days (I'm already quarantined) I'll buy one of those expensive home tests and we'll see what it says.
"And in general, I feel short of breath whenever anyone brings up covid."
Look for #'s to pick up in the next 1-2 days.
Both are spreading medical misinformation which will lead to people dying and both have cult-like mindsets around masks.
It seems like the life I used to know will never come back and from now on I will be confined to living through a screen for the rest of my life.
After hearing about a couple friends get thrashed after the 2nd one it got my mind running a bit.
Or should I stay home and lose a couple hundo on those tickets?
And then there is the question of her traveling back (flying) and possibly being contagious on that leg of the journey after being with her parents.
We are both in our mid 30s. <SEP> I dont want to catch it again. <SEP> I stress being sick and having the whole family sick. <SEP> My mind dives into the negatives all the time. <SEP> Wish I knew how protected I was.
"So looking at where things are right now, I really hope this winter wont be even worse than the last If any of you have any support regarding this, Id love to hear it :)"
"( my diet is good in general , sleeping well and not drinking) I visit a therapist to adress any mental health issues but I am wondering if that state is influenced from covid ( after reading some articles about the post covid brain fog) Has anyone experienced any similar?"
But some voice in my head won't just shut up.
"i am continously losing my mind, if this thing is not over soon i am gonna go crazy"
Should I start wearing a mask at home?
"Anyways, I predict that after Covid ravages the unvaccinated in the more unvaccinated parts of the Southern US and as we approach winter, Covid will move more north.."
Got a Breakthrough case from someone who was also vaccinated.
"However, Walmart denied me another <ORG> shot, so I went to the CVS, I lied, and told them it was my first shot, and got a <ORG> shot instead."
"I don't know if my dream to end the pandemic early next year will come true or not, but with FDA approval vaccines for the kids are coming, let's hope that's the case."
Would my experience still be considered a loss of taste and smell even though its not completely gone? <SEP> What was your experience like?
"In your opinion - would it be unreasonable or self-centred of me to ask my SO that only vaccinated people visit our home from now on? <SEP> As with everything with Covid-19, this is unchartered territory and I just don't know if it would come across as controlling or unrealistic for me to ask for this."
Going forward though - I can't help but be worried about the fact that my SO has one or two other friends who are unvaccinated and I don't really want this scenario to keep popping up over and over again.
What are the best practices for those who are vaccinated who come into contact with folks who have tested positive for Covid?
Should I wait more before getting the jab?
It looks like the second doses seem to be overtaking the 1st doses.
I am in desperate need of therapy to help me navigate through this pandemic and I have not been able to find any practices in my area on my insurance that are accepting new patients due to an overwhelming demand for services.
"So my question is, how do I mitigate the spins after this has blown over?"
"They are all vaccinated, but I am not sure if she had gotten the third booster shot."
"According to <PERSON>, he says if we want this pandemic to end in Spring 2022, it's up to us."
"I can either potentially wreck any relationships i have with my peers, or get anxious/depressed/near suicidal due to it."
"And just how low do daily cases have to get in order for the US to be considered ""Covid-free""?"
"will the average person eventually be able to get a booster shot, thus accounting for alleged waning immunity?"
"I guess the first dose could work as a booster, but what could happen with the complete vaccination?"
I blew my nose and everything beforehand and tried to clear excess blood from my nostrils before the test.
I havent gotten sick and dont think I will from the natural immunity from having it so recently and plan on getting the vaccine whenever Im not busy.
I test my kid weekly via a mail in PCR saliva test my state provides.
I'm a little confused about 'people at increased risk for severe illness' and the new category of 'people who are at high risk of professional exposure'.
Is it ok for me to ask what their vaccination status is before I meet up with them? <SEP> Or am I asking too much?
In super scared of brain damage of any kind and even though I'm vaccinated I feel like I'm doomed to get covid and get brain damage :( anyone can interpret this better than I?
"Hey I just have a question about getting COVID-19 After Fully Vaccinated. <SEP> I recently felt sick, but not sure if it's covid or something else. <SEP> I'm not sure if it's flu like symptoms or covid."
"Has anyone experienced post covid/long covid anxiety like this? <SEP> Meaning not necessarily because one is afraid of covid. <SEP> It just simply happens. <SEP> If so, what has helped you? <SEP> How long has it been happening? <SEP> Has it gone away for you? <SEP> Thank you."
"&amp;#x200B; My thoughts are that I'm not sure about the accuracy of the test or if the incubation period has been long enough to develop a positive test result, or even if there is a likelihood of a breakthrough infection from being exposed to the unvaccinated Covid positive brother. <SEP> The babysitter is eager to get back to work. <SEP> Aside from the fact that I am pretty unhappy about her lack of masking, when would it theoretically be safe to let her come back and be with our unvaccinated kids?"
I called CDC but did not get an answer. <SEP> Should I quarantine?
"Please tell me everything be okay, especially with staying in-person this year"
Are you planning to get a booster if youre eligible or even if youre not? <SEP> What are the factors informing your decision?
"Hi, me and my Fiancee are getting married in two weeks. <SEP> as i wrote in the title, my fiancee is very nervous about the wedding and about the covid situation, considering her reaction to the 1st shot of <ORG> Vac."
"And I really do want too get too the time where we don't have too wear masks anymore, even if everyone around me is wearing one."
"Breakthrough cases are supposed to be 1 in 500, what are the odds of 3 of them in one household?"
Now I can't tell if this is totally safe or a super reckless decision. <SEP> I'm considering going but standing outside of the crowd.
I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire.
What are the chances cigarette smoke can infect me? <SEP> Im double vaccinated but live and work with high risk individuals so now Im worried.
"Just how certain is it that the booster wont make me feel more sick as the second shot, to the point of affecting tinnitus?"
"If we go to my Aunt's home for the Christmas holiday with my cousin, her husband, and their two kids and we come home, we should be safe right?"
"Do I have cold symptoms or COVID, am not sure."
Should I seize the travel opportunity and get it?
So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from?
"I can't find reliable information online, I want to know how long after contracting COVID will my SO test negative."
"I guess what I want to know is, has anyone else here had a fever last a week or more after getting the booster?"
The staggered nature of our symptoms/test results is whats causing the uncertainty around what best practices should be here and we want to make sure were being safe.
"So I ask my fellow sufferers of covid anxiety, how do you chill TF out?"
Please tell me if Im being over dramatic and have no reason to be concerned
Is he crazy ? <SEP> Is he doing harm to himself by doing this ?
Im so anxious about omicron because hardly anyone has boosters yet though.
Which continued all of day two and now into day three Im still weak and having joint pain. <SEP> How long will this last?
How long is the fevers usually lasting in children with this.
Should I let her go in there with them since she tested positive?
"In fact, cases in NJ are almost matching last winters peak and I wouldnt be surprised if it goes above that and then some."
"&amp;#x200B; In short, do I have full vaccine protection or do I need to take yet another shot because I waited 5 months between shots?"
Should I get my vaccine early? <SEP> Is there any drawbacks?
"So, when the virus mutates, is it reasonable to suppose that it might have found ways to transmit through fomites or food?"
I think that maybe 98% of us are going to acquire the infection regardless of vaccination status and there is no way to stop it.
My major requires me to study abroad so I know the topic of vaccination will come up soon and I just need some tools on how to approach the subject without possibly losing contact with my parents.
My situation being risking what is *probably* my certain death in pursuit of earning less than nine dollars an hour.
Anything to keep this feeling of dieing inside and my youth being devoured by this at bay.
"It will get better very soon, I can guarantee that."
"I dont have major holiday plans, but Im nervous to go into the grocery store because theres a good chance Im probably going to run into omicron one way or the other."
"As soon as I heard about other countries (Israel) doing boosters, I went and got a <ORG> booster beginning of August."
"My main concern, however, is that I go and see my parents who are in their early 70s."
"Can an antibody test give me any insight whatsoever as to whether I may have just had covid? <SEP> Can they differentiate between the vax and natural immunity at all? <SEP> And also, can they tell the levels of antibodies to know if I have a good level or protection or not?"
Do you think I'm still getting the full benefits of the booster even with no signs of any immune response?
"Is it possible that she still has COVID, and not have transmitted to any of us even though it's extremely unlikely?"
how can I find a balance? <SEP> how can you all find a balance between keeping yourself informed and the anxiety?
Will this still be enough to offer them some protection against Omicron until they can get the booster?
Does anyone suggest maybe 4 or 5 weeks instead of 3 or something like that or have any more knowledge on this aspect?
"I have read that 3 doses of mRNA vaccines provide the best protection against Omicron, but would it be too much since I first had a J&amp;J?"
"Now, my question is... do you think it is safe for us to celebrate Christmas together?"
"So would there be any harm, or make a difference, if I took a <ORG> booster instead of <ORG>?"
Looking if there is any tips on how to recover faster and avoid long covid.
"if she didnt get sick because of my dad, and was exposed to him consistently, is it likely that she wont get infected by me, either?"
Is there any basis to my fears or are these shots actually safe?
I've been asking around as to whether we should get boosters or not and i keep getting mixed answers.
So is there a timeline of symptoms for someone who is fully vaxxed and catches covid?
"&amp;#x200B; Am I doing the right thing? <SEP> What if I had it a month ago and didn't notice, and I test positive because of the antibody and it's just a cold masquerading as COVID symptoms? <SEP> How do I deal with the burden of potentially ruining the holidays of all my friends, putting others at risk?"
"As the title states, I would greatly appreciate some insight on how long it took you (or someone you know) who is FULLY VACCINATED (two doses) to test negative after being infected."
Is there any chance we didnt get it?
When can I stop worrying about getting pneumonia?
This begs the question: When will we have enough data? <SEP> How much time will scientists need with the variant to make a determination that satisfies these article writers?
I am so worried and Im having a panic attack about going to Christmas with my other family even if my COVID test comes back negative I think its irresponsible at this point.
Could it be that I may avoid getting it ar Christmas?
Just wondering what other vaccinated people's experiences are who have been infected with what they believe to be the Omicron variant.
Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this stress?
I have to come in contact with only 5 people but I am constantly freaking out.
It looks like there's no smart way to let them come anyway but I am trying to see if there's anything we are missing.
But I didn't know if anybody else who got the vaccine shortly after they got COVID felt like crap after receiving their vaccines.
I want to so bad and I know statistically speaking nothing drastic is likely to happen but I just want to do the right thing.
Does me not feeling bad mean I have a bad immune system that just wasn't reacting or something?
"I know it says I am negative, however has anyone taken an at home rapid test and had the weird line show up on the right side vertically?"
Idk how to explain this but has anyone else felt like they're forehead and face has what I would describe as windburn?
"If it turns up negative again, does that mean it could be a false positive?"
im not used to being alone like this with no human contact at all which keeps me crying every now and then lol does anyone have advice on dealing with this boredom and loneliness/sadness?
Poll: Would you go to this Christmas dinner tonight if youre 2x vaccinated and boosted?
She also handed him some gifts.
I'm pulling my hair out because that's when I think the upcoming surge is going to be at its worst with people spreading it from Christmas gatherings.
"Beyond double masking, social distancing, and good hygiene, what else can I do to be as safe as possible?"
"Of course there is no definite answer, but around when can I expect to test negative on a PCR? <SEP> It has been 4 days since my test now and I am feeling fine with no symptoms. <SEP> Also- is it possible I test positive on antigen but not PCR (I can do antigens everyday, was just gonna keep doing them and then immediately order same day PCR when I am neg)"
"Most gyms in my area have opened back up with guidelines of ""if you are not vaccinated you need to wear a mask,"" but frankly, I don't trust people to be honest about their status and the BJJ crowd seems like the type to shy away from the vaccine (plus wearing a mask seems worthless in that situation)."
"Both of us are fully vaccinated and boosted, btw."
"I don't know which one to choose, and what kind of symptoms I should expect after such 'mixture' of having a different vaccine as my 3rd dose."
"I guess my real question here is: Has anyone gotten COVID (tested positive and everything) and then gotten a negative test within a few days? <SEP> Also, has anyone experience getting a false positive test OR anyone know if you can test positive even if its just the flu?"
"However, do you guys think it's likely the Omicron could be the final variant that will raise any sort of concern and/or fearmongering from the media? <SEP> Also, what are the possibilities of a variant far more deadlier than Delta emerging?"
I'm not sure if I'll test negative by Friday because I still don't have my sense of taste and smell.
"My vaccination status tells me my symptoms will not be severe, and that seems to be the case so far."
"Am I ""immune"" for 90 days now? <SEP> Does this mean that if I'm in an environment where someone else tests positive within that time period, I don't have to react?"
Which means more mask mandates and more restrictions.
"If I'm already over the curve, and my lingering symptoms or just general blah, no smell, limited taste, and I bring my girlfriend over who is still knee deep in covid with having cough attacks and throwing up everything she eats or drinks, is this going to mess me up with my test results later in the week? <SEP> Is this going to prohibit me from going back to work next week?"
All of a sudden this past couple of days Ive been having weird parosmia signs.
"For those similar to my scenario, did you run to get antibodies? <SEP> Anyone rush to get the new pills?"
Does that mean we might need to get the booster shot again several times or that restrictions will last into the next year?
The CDC said positive people should isolate for 5 days instead of 10 but if it's only motivated by needing people back to work then is it the right advice to follow?
So Im just wondering would it had been possible for her to reinfect me?
"I have a normally VERY strong immune system somehow and I never get sick, even when Ive been exposed directly to the flu its rare that I ever actually come down with it myself."
"I don't know - it seems kind of like we're making up our own rules, but it could also be a good idea? <SEP> At the same time there's so much unknown: What if institutions start mandating boosters? <SEP> What if we get omicron before we can get our boosters? <SEP> Are we being stupid about this?"
"If it comes back negative and I remain symptom free, do you think Im in the clear?"
As a side note how would you advise calming down a very scared spouse?
"Do you have any suggestions on what to do, like a nice live on twitch or YT or Instagram, or a program, or a chatroom for quarantined people, or anything that you think would make the countdown a little less lonely?"
"If this truly ends up being as mild as the seasonal Flu, shouldn't we encourage this one to be the one that embeds into our society?"
When should you test after exposure for the most accurate results?
"I had covid 3 months ago and have both my vaccines, so I'd say I'm at quite a strong immunity at the moment (plus yesterday we was literally bleaching and cleaning for 8 hours, so IF she has it as well then I doubt it could have survived long lol)."
is it possible that a new covid variant could emerge in the future that could can cause vaccinated people to get as sick as unvaccinated people?
Because thanks to Omicron (Even though its mild) well never end this pandemic.
Will that help lessen any possible myocarditis at all? <SEP> Do yall have any tips?
"about 2-3 hours later about to throw it out and noticed the following: [url] Not sure how to interpret this. <SEP> The line is not at the T, and is curved, and appeared after 15 min."
"She was at a Christmas Eve family event where everyone was supposed to be vaccinated and symptom free, but someone brought her young daughter who ""had a cold"" and surprise surprise, its COVID."
"My question is: given all of this, does four and a half days past the potential exposure point sound like a reasonable isolation time before going back to my parents' place?"
"According to the linked article the risk of a heart problem from the pfizer vaccine is 1 in 50,000. <SEP> What's the risk from 3,4,5,6 shots though?"
[url] This is technically a YouTube video but this guy knows what he is talking about.
"His ten days (guideline where I live) wont be up though, so Im hoping some people, perhaps more up to date on research, could weigh in."
Ive been up all night with a tickle in my throat and its literally almost making me gag nonstop. <SEP> Did this happen to anyone else?
"The director of the WHO held a news conference yesterday stating that countries need to hold off on giving boosters so that poorer countries are able to get at least first doses into arms. <SEP> My question is this: why arent we, as richer nations (Im assuming that most individuals here are from richer nations), doing this?"
"I wasnt given an information sheet with the booster so could someone tell me if the redness, warmth and lump are a normal reaction to the booster?"
"Now that I am vaccinated, I would like to know if there are any general rules or ways to decide what things I should or shouldn't do, particularly with the new variants, such as the Omicron variant going around."
Could the COVID vaccine also cause loss of taste and smell?
"i'm seriously considering just taking next semester off because as of right now my university is planning to have zero virtual options which i don't love because it'll encourage an already careless student body to be even more careless, but i'm also afraid they're going to go fully virtual again and i know i can't handle that."
"I didnt feel anything until I tried to do some cardio, I workout a lot and the sessions are nothing out of the usual, but suddenly every single one feels like hell."
"Fever is something that comes and goes every 4,5 hours but sore throat is pretty much there and got worse actually.Is the sore throat normal while recovering?"
"Does anybody have any up to date information on how long the <ORG> booster will be effective, and will it be effective against Omicron and Delta for the same length of time?"
Our OB is currently out of the office with Covid herself so our biggest medical rock is unavailable for the time being. <SEP> Any helpful advice would be appreciated.
I got the booster two days ago and now I'm wondering if I need to continue to social distance/quarantine for 2 weeks or is it okay to start being around people like normal?
"if this wave is supposedly going to be over by february, do i grit my teeth and mask/avoid them in the house?"
"I read and my provinces info said not to get tested if youre asymptomatic, and shoppers testing thing said to test there if asymptomatic and without being in contact with a positive case."
Whats going on here? <SEP> Why is this somehow permanent for a lot of people? <SEP> What should I do? <SEP> Has your taste/smell come back? <SEP> When?
Do you think it's necessary to isolate if neither of us are + or showing symptoms yet?
"Assuming my mother has caught COVID yesterday, how long before she would become infectious herself?"
What are the chances she has it and is asymptomatic?
Should I assume the Rapid Test kit is wrong since I always hear they are inaccurate?
I often find myself questioning anything I have to outside of the house and I'm not quite sure if its because its the right thing or has my anxiety gotten to me?
Why haven't I heard of COVID vaccines being modified with the rise of the Omicron variant?
"If anyone else in high school has gotten covid, how did you manage to recover from the missed time"
"Those who have been sick, about how long did it take before you tested negative?"
How should I interpret this negative result? <SEP> Am I super paranoid or was the time frame in which I got tested too soon/late?
Im just seeking some insight on the use of oxygen at home after Covid and how long most people need it.
So is there another way out of this since vaccinating the world isnt a realistic option?
Based on the dates above can anyone help me figure out when my roommate will no longer be contagious and what estimated date is safe for me to go back to my apartment?
I'm hoping I won't get sick again... what are the chances of me getting reinfected after a month? <SEP> I really only fully recovered around December 10th.
Do you you think we're probably okay or was it too soon to take the antigen test?
&amp;#x200B; Does this mean I am no longer contagious? <SEP> If a lateral flow comes back as negative is it likely my PCR will also?
Is it safe to go home on Tuesday? <SEP> Would I be contagious at all?
Is this normal or am i developing flu or pneumonia ?Hope it's not pneumonia i am shit scared of post covid pneumonia Imfao
Do you think if Im safe my chances of getting it at his office are low?
"Anyone else been here or had a family member in this position? <SEP> Any tips to help him not panic to keep his breathing steady? <SEP> Any tips for me and what I should be asking the doctors, etc?"
Geuss I should just assume that Im gonna get it?
"If you have had Covid and lost your taste, how long could you not taste for? <SEP> Any tips on how to make my sense of taste come back quickly?"
"Can I have it again after only getting it 20 days ago, or is it just a false positive?"
1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)?
I'm pretty sure I have COVID and the testing tommorow will likely confirm that.
"I know that mixing brands is safe, but is it as *effective*?"
I'm just wondering if this odd surge of flu-like symptoms has gotten something to do with Omicron?
"With everyone getting covid and cancelling trips, I feel like I need to take some action between now and then to protect myself."
I just want to enjoy university life but this threat of catching covid is just looming over my head like some kind of inevitable fate.
"I found a few more predictions like some experts say that the Omicron will peak in January 9th or mid January or end of January, but now I feel like I need to be careful what to expect."
Obviously things could mutate again but I see people writing the whole year off and am wondering if I'm missing something?
I am wondering how are you managing or how did you manage a household where some tested negative for COVID and others tested positive?
Our government made a vaccin passport and we cannot go to restaurants or do interior activities without it. <SEP> I consider myself a very responsible citizen and I would like your opinions in a polite manner.
"I know the pandemic will end eventually, but with more variants most likely coming soon, Im not sure if itll ever end."
"Considering all of this, I'm thinking of waiting until they come out with a new booster that includes new variants."
"If its been 24+ hours, is there any reason I cant get in the car, maskless, and drive around?"
"Most likely scenario I see rn is I get boosted, deal with *that* again, and then still end up catching covid, having to quarrantine, etc and my only consolation is that I don't get *as* sick."
So is she positive or negative? <SEP> Is she contagious?
Has anyone experienced this and there sense of smell returned back to normal?
With all of the rules and cases Im just not sure what the right thing to do is.
What are people's experiences? <SEP> I'm feeling completely lost and have no one to talk to who I can relate to :(
Can I still test positive for Covid after that long?
I'd like to be vaccinated and I'd also like to know which vaccines are effective against omicron.
I've heard way too many stories of false negatives.
The whole world isn't going to be vaccinated \- It seems like we will have mandated mask wearing forever.
Is there a chance I get/have gotten brain damage from being infected?
"Can you help me think through the risks here? <SEP> I don't want to end his quarantine before it's logical to do so, but I can see the effect it's having..."
I get easily anxious by these things and wondering(for those who have had covid) how you felt on the first morning/day you began to show symptoms.
"The surge in omnicron crashed in Africa just about four weeks after peaking, remember?"
"* Case counts may be high, but hospitals are not at capacity due to vaccines, improved treatments, and the actual virus getting milder I'm looking forward to not feeling stressed in non-vax-controlled environments when someone coughs or doesn't mask properly."
Anyone has tried anything to reduce or mitigiate the brain fog?
Ive accepted that I will probably have it at some point and can only hope for the best and take precautions.
People freaking out about long-term hospital capacity problems from flu + COVID and talking about virtual activity well into the Spring.
Itd be a little relieving to know if anyone else experienced this?
Has anyone heard of a similar case and the outcome?
"Should I quarantine and if so for how long? <SEP> What day should I get a test, day 5 after the close contact? <SEP> Rapid or PCR?"
"I guess I'm looking for reassurance from those who have had COVID, especially if you know or suspect it was omicron."
What happens to them? <SEP> Do they get ridiculed for something they can't control? <SEP> What can they do to help against this virus if they can't get the vaccine?
"Has anyone else been navigating these waters with mixed feelings, or dealing with a co-parent that is on the opposite side of the fence?"
And how long do I need to stay in my isolated room until I recover?
"And with omicron everywhere, should we rush to get the booster or confirm he doesnt have covid first since its like wildfire everywhere here (cant find rapid tests locally right now either)."
"Is using one test good enough or are there any that are solely 1 test and that's it, you're done?"
"Ever since, I've had hives and itching across my back. <SEP> Maybe my body cross-reacting to the virus because it recognizes it from the vaccine it also reacted to... ?"
Do we think its okay to leave my room and spend time with family again?
Anyone take vitamins daily and caught covid but it was mild?
Is this safe?
"There's also the fears theorists have put on my head, like infertility or altered DNA. <SEP> Did I do it right?"
"If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? <SEP> It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. <SEP> if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this."
What are the chances I could have still passed it on to my family?
"Just a daily concern of mine in relation to the pandemic, I'm still stressed, it doesn't seem to end this year, I put in my head the goal of calming down with this situation until 2023 (which is the average time for us to see an improvement) but everything seems so chaotic and I'm worried about my mother's health, she doesn't have any comorbidities or anything like that, quite the opposite, she's probably even healthier than me, but she's 63 years old, I worry about her daily, even though she's super pro vaccine and would definitely take a dose every day if needed (we'll take the booster on the 19th) anyway, I just wonder if one day I'll be able to go to a premiere cinema again without a mask, and come home without worrying about giving her something"
"Normally I'd think the risk is probably pretty low, but with numbers this high I'm not sure what to think."
"Would it be safe for him to visit, or should I wait longer to make sure there's no chance of transmission?"
"I'm particularly interested in information of Omicron in young children (my son is 1 yo) compared to the previous variants, but it would be great to have a general resources."
"I'm worried about my mother's health, she doesn't have any comorbidities or anything like that, quite the opposite, she's probably even healthier than me, but she's 63 years old, I worry about her daily, even though she's super pro vaccine and would definitely take a dose every day if needed (we'll take the booster on the 19th) anyway, should I cancel my presence or anything like so?"
I don't want to unless I *need to*. <SEP> But I absolutely will do anything that I need to do.
Does anybody know how long one should wait after receiving a positive test to hug and kiss and such?
"I don't see how there will be a full return to in-person classes without a huge surge on campus, and I don't know how I am going to avoid getting it, from classes or my job."
"If I touch a surface a covid infected person just sneezed, what is my risk if i then touch or lick my hand, etc? <SEP> What is someone sneezes in my food?"
I can't really find any definitive advice out there either - planes are safer than airports but how does that compare to mass transit?
"Should I talk to my boss on Monday, explain the situation, and try to use vacation to cover it? <SEP> Or should I follow the CDC and my work's guidelines?"
"my therapist is in the hospital dying of covid and yes, ive been in therapy since before the start of the pandemic"
What do you think we should do? <SEP> What would you do?
"Anyone have advice regarding anxiety and/or maybe supporting evidence about the rareness of these side effects in the vaccines, what they were linked to or caused by?"
"I'm wondering for other people who are tripled or double vaxxed who ended up getting COVID-19, what was your course of illness like?"
"Not sure if this is covid related, as everything else seems to smell like normal."
"Ill stay alive for now, but once it reaches fall 2024, when Ill have completed an associates degree and will be moving on to university, I have a vague plan to possibly end my life if its still like this at that point."
How can I make sure I get Covid tomorrow?
Anyone else experience symptoms like this and it was covid?
Should I reschedule for a couple weeks out or should I go ahead and get the booster tomorrow?
Has anyone else had something similar happed to them?
What are the chances of catching something from them being in here for about am hour?
"Seeing a positive today, Im wondering if she didnt have it then but does now, or if its just still in her system."
I am scared anyone with the same experience?
are we right in that she can't actually find out if she's contracted it for at least 5 days? <SEP> what are she/we to do in the time between her exposure and when she can find out if she actually has it?
"I know I'm not out of the possible incubation period, but I just feel like I can't be so lucky as to have direct exposure and not get sick this time."
"Im not meaning this judgementally at all Im just genuinely curious what that looks like to people, or maybe they dont know but they are just desperate for something to change which I totally get"
"How screwed am I? <SEP> I know my body is fighting off the vaccine rn, but is it possible that I've may have caught COVID due to me weakened immune system?"
"That said, I was wondering if anyone else has observed significant changes to their eating habits, and whether this has coincided with any major changes in circumstances and wellbeing."
Are there anymore precautions I can take or advise my family to take?
"I'm thinking of holding off on taking care of my medical needs until the end of the year when I can hopefully switch to LA-based services. <SEP> I was wondering if this sounds... logical given the situation right now, or if I am being too paranoid."
Everyone at my office is sick and it's shit timing too because I had the booster 2 days ago and I can't tell if im feeling symptoms from that or if I somehow got the omicron because my immune system was weak due to the booster.
Lol amazingly enough this is the first time someone I'm regularly around has tested positive and with all the changes I'm kinda lost
"Is it worth getting tested again, even with no real ""Covid"" symptoms and being past my symptoms?"
"Basically I just want to ask, with omicron, can one test positive in less of 24 hours of possible exposure?"
Has anyone else had brain fog after the vaccine for a long time?
Can she take booster dose with passport as identification?
despite everything i still see an end to the pandemic.
I got the <ORG> booster (mix &amp; match) at Costco and had a little sore arm and that was it.
But since my kids/wife/myself just had it 3 weeks ago would we still be fairly immune?
Has anyone else experienced this?
it seems like the odds are pretty low as i have mostly stayed at home and stay masked up anytime i have been out
"Aside from masking around the house, and staying confined to my room as much as possible, is there anything I can do?"
"I was told this was likely due to a different illness clogging my eustachian tubes and preventing my sinuses/ears from draining properly, leading to infection."
Is it really that different in other places in the US or are people in other countries?
But does this value give me any indication of 1) Whether I had covid or is this from the vax?
Or can she consider herself not infected?
"Hi everyone, does anyone know whether my risk of getting heart inflammation from a booster vaccine increases if I received heart inflammation when I got my first vaccine shot?"
"Considering I tested negative, but the lab noted the presence of a small viral load; does this means Im going to develop COVID again?"
Should I get tested now or should I wait til around Monday-ish?
What challenges I might face and when should I call for hospitalization?
So my questions are: Is it safe to be in contact with someone who has quarantined? <SEP> Especially when hes going to live with you?
"1) what is the general outlook for my mother. <SEP> 2) my father is about 52, and has well managed type 2 diabetes, so im worried about the outlook for my dad as well."
I thought I was supposed to have some sort of immunity! <SEP> So how do I know if it's lingering old infection or new one?
"I've heard from a couple of sources, probably doomer sources but anyway, that there is no guarantee that covid-19 will become milder with time and it's unlikely to become endemic in the future, i.e. <SEP> this year or the next few years, simply due to this fact."
"So isn't the question - who has more power, the ones benefiting from this new normal, or those that want it to return to previous times?"
"I was feeling a little manic that day from all of the confusion and ended up digging that test out of the trash after about an hour and it looked like there was a positive line there, but it wasnt there the first time."
Thus I wanted to know if the current requirements for international travel will be waived/removed completely when that time comes.
Did anyone actually test for omicron specifically and have symptoms for 8+ days that included loss of taste and smell?
Right now I'm getting scared that life when covid becomes endemic won't be much better.
What are the chances I test positive still?
"Ive heard that they are going too any time now, and even have already started to in certain areas."
I'm supposed to go back to work on Monday and my kid can go back to school Tuesday.
"my temperature is normal, I'm not feverish anymore, but I feel as if I am, you know what I mean?"
"Hello, my 14-month-old has a known exposure at daycare, she has had two very faint lines on home tests."
So my rapid test was negative and I'm wondering now if it's ok for me to go back to work and be out in the community tomorrow.
"I know were in the bad winter right now, especially that damn Omicron, but Ive heard the Omicron is peaking and so far Ive heard the cases are declining in some states."
Now I know the masks I bought were a ripoff. <SEP> Can anyone steer me towards a brand that is good?
"I'm mostly over my Omicron symptoms at this point other than the occasional headache and some lingering dry cough, but the one thing that is bothering me the most is my lower back."
My mom tested positive a few days ago.
"Despite all of that, I still feel optimistic, that one day once all of this is over, I'm gonna be able to go back to the places that I've always wanted to go back to, get more opportunities, and of course, rebuild my life to the life that I had before the pandemic, but this time an improved one, as I've learned a lot about life during the pandemic, so that's a plus I guess."
"Perhaps because of this, I do feel very optimstic looking ahead now, things do feel like they are slowly getting better."
"Sorry for the idiotic question, but I'm having a hard time understanding the CDC's recommendations for isolating/masking."
Has anyone else experienced this?
I fear that chance is gone now considering these years are supposed to be the prime of my life and I'm gonna miss out on so much and be bitter about it for the rest of my life.
"My mom is supposed to get her ""booster"" this month , which would be her 4th shot, and is nervous."
"I work from home every day and I know there are folks who need the tests for work, travel, school, etc., so I dont feel like I should get tested."
"But today, she started running a fever, and I'm wondering if there are any warning signs I should be looking for."
"If my rapid test tomorrow night also comes in negative, am I good to go into work Wednesday (even if my throat is still slightly sore)?"
Did anyone here have a similar experience? <SEP> Did it end up being COVID or just a flu? <SEP> Would a PCR test give me reliable results if it was omicron?
[[url] There is so much information going on that I am having trouble making sense of it.
Is anyone else going through this?
"Now, Covid can't be 100% be ruled out by the test."
Is this something I should be worried about? <SEP> What can I do?
"Recently 4 people including myself had symptoms that could be either covid or just plain ol' flu but we're already vaccinated, is there a way to test if we had it 2 weeks ago?"
"I've heard estimates ranging from 3x to 10x the official numbers with previous variants, but is there anything specific to omicron?"
How would Walgreens handle me saying I didn't know my insurance information?
"My friend's dad who is a doctor in India says yes the booster will provide extra protection on top of the natural antibodies, but some others say it doesn't really matter, so idk who to believe."
Is it extra safe to hang out with this person relative to other people because they cant spread omicron anymore after having already had it?
"Im 21F and dont have any conditions that would make me at higher risk with COVID, Im just looking for some comfort from others who had COVID and didnt end up in the hospital."
"My co worker also has gotten sick again, like a day or two before me but it sounds like he's been worse off than myself, just wondering if anyone can share any insights or share their experiences."
"In addition, does anyone else in a large group setting have tips for managing such a large household?"
"I know the simple answer is go to the doctor, and I plan to get a drive though rapid test tomorrow (just to be safe), but I wanted to know others thoughts."
Anyone has feel tinging in their lungs after all the symptoms have disappeared?
"Its safe to receive a package a week from now that someone who had/has COVID handled, right?"
"The Corona information websites in our home country (Sweden) doesn't really say much about these things, and when googling there seems to be mixed information."
"my boyfriend is a teacher, one of the teachers in his grade tested positive yesterday, he had not been around her unmasked but he was unmasked in her classroom (she wasnt there at the time) for a max of 3-5 minutes."
"Obviously they are both positive, but wondering if this means I'm in for a bad week or two."
But also covid is just gonna be worse on my body if I dont get it again.
Would there be a (significant) risk of me catching something from her even two weeks after having symptoms?
How long is optimal to wait after getting over Covid before getting boosted?
"I have no idea what's going on, should I stay away from my family? <SEP> Should I go to school tomorrow? <SEP> Should I see my friends? <SEP> Are the tests inaccurate?"
"Hi, I've scheduled a for international flights required pcr test and want to know, what I can do in order to prevent that test of being negative."
How do self test kits work and are there ones that exist that arent 30$ cuz I am broke for money and I assume I can't get reimbursed because I don't have health insurance.
If I have no other symptoms Other than the cough will it just go away?
I keep reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is sort of a pointless risk- why risk the side-effects of the booster when it won't even help me?
Its very confusing and if someone could help me figure this out I would be very grateful!!
"i wont be putting anyone at risk, right?"
I know the protection is less with Omicron but nonetheless I've see mixed thoughts on if it does anything.
"Many leaders in health and politics, even hospital managers and chief epidemiologist rlfur Gunason who has been notoriously cautious throughout are saying its time to end restrctions and it seems this will finally be done in the coming weeks :) Secondly, Kri Stefnsson, doctor and founder of a genetics company which has helped tremendously against COVID here is now saying that thanks to Omicrons mildness, the extremely high infection rate among (especially young) Icelanders and the successful vaccine programme that he very much expects we will be out of the pandemic phase by early April!"
I was wondering if anybody has gotten a similar reaction?
"Meanwhile, I spoke with my pcp and he told me to wait 3 months???"
"Thing is, the entries for my first two shots are blank. <SEP> What do? <SEP> Can I fill in the info myself? <SEP> Should I even bother with the paper card at all?"
"Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen."
I can just see another lockdown coming maybe in the winter.
Basically I looked at the Bloomberg tracker and saw that the USA will take another *8 months* to reach herd while Canada will only take four more *weeks*.
"I was feeling hopeful for a while. <SEP> For a month, cases were dropping and I was feeling like we were gonna get out of this."
But I'm having such a hard time not being anxious when my county is so slow too decide on whether too mandate masks again.
Because I have anxiety I just wanted to know like i expect the possibility of a LITTLE chills or warmth or headache or tiredness but for the serious stuff how long do I know Im in the clear?
The idea of having to go back to square one upsets me.
"For anyone worried about when the pandemic will end, the WHO has set a goal for 10% of the worlds population to be vaccinated by the end of September, 40% by the end of the year and finally 70% by mid 2022, the last goal which will end the pandemic."
Will the recent vaccination effect the test? <SEP> Does it even make sense for me to bother with the test since I'm vaccinated?
Will it be reasonable for me to make this trip or are things too uncertain right now with the variant?
"I obviously dont want to be a party pooper and not go or go but not ride any rides or eat anything, but I dont know how to have a nice time when I see posts about people still going to Disneyland even with a positive test just because they really want to go to the park."
"I want to postpone my attendance to celebrate with them, but how many days should I wait?"
Does covid became just another bad cold that we get once in a while and need a booster for or does it ever completely go away?
I have tested positive for COVID today (lateral flow test) but I'm not sure if it's due to the vaccination that I have tested positive or if it's due to actually catching it from the person who I was working with.
"He has been fully vaccinated for months now, so I thought the chances of this were low. <SEP> He's is late 60s, a past autoimmune condition but relatively healthy overall. <SEP> It was a rapid test, so maybe it's wrong?"
It sucks to think that some of these may never come back because of businesses/industries folding and the general population losing interest in these activities.
"I don't know how true it is, but look what I found: [[url] It looks like the FDA is going to approve the booster vaccines in within 48 hours."
Missouri looks like it is finally on the downhill slope.
Ive gotten COVID-19 last Friday and I might lose my sense of smell and taste within the next couple days.
That means we should only expect the rest of the year to be more and more and more and more case climbing and zero chances of flattening. <SEP> Fact: cases are NOT crashing even with vaccinations and there are only going to be even more and more and more and more and MORE increases week after week. <SEP> Expect each week to be nothing but more and more gains and zero declines.
we will get through this and the roaring twenties will return!
"I don't want to get this disease and die or be left with permanent brain/organ damage ;-; Only a tiny number of people is vaccinated in Romania (where I live), and it seems like the number is going to cap off at less than 50% because anti-vaxx propaganda caught on strong here"
Plan to get a booster vaccine as soon as available.
"One things I am slightly worried about in this process is getting my ""vaccination passport"" as this is my main goal (to be able to travel to the EU and other countries still locked to the unvaccinated) once it's time for me to return to Europe."
"In addition, the USA is the only country where so many people refuse to take their vaccines, meaning that we'll breed a new variant that is immune to all the current vaccines."
It feels like this will never end.
I'm just worried for the rare severe side effects.. like GBS or Blood Clots.. even knowing how rare they are I can't help but think I'm 200% guaranteed to have one of them and be doomed..
"I was starting to panic when i realised I'd been eating blackcurrant flavoured throat soothers all day for my sore throat, and remembered hearing a lot about blackcurrant causing false positives, so should i be worried?"
People are talking about the likelihood of classes going online again.
"Even some experts say that herd immunity is impossible. <SEP> So, is there such a thing as a herd immunity? <SEP> If no, then how do we know that everybody get's vaccinated and what's the real immunity we need?"
"I have known people who have had to go to the hospital, and even though the odds are slim, people have died from the vaccine which means I possibly could as well."
Right now my area hasn't actually gotten out of its third wave and there's already news of a fourth on the way.
"However, things are going to be in person, and I just don't know if I can handle the sudden shift from not leaving my room (let alone my house) at all, to being in multiple classrooms full of students multiple times a week, and living in a dormroom."
"However, i am concerned it might be a rapid test and could be a false negative."
"Seeing as this is most likely a precautionary measure until cases drop considerably, I was just wondering, about how much longer do you think the fully vaccinated will have to make this sacrifice, provided a vaccine approval for ages 5-11 will likely occur in early winter?"
"I'm just hoping that after that the mandate gets lifted, and if it doesant any time soon then i might consider going fully online (also i wouldent have to wake up early too.)"
"They dont wear masks when leaving the house and a friend of theirs will also be there (Im not sure if hes vaccinated) I would wear a masks at all times, but that kind of wont be possible as Ill be sleeping at their house for a night or two."
Otherwise how else can I be happy when it seems the world is declining before our very eyes?
"Now I go out, trying to get my life back, but Im freaking out on the inside."
"On Thursday evening I attended a BBQ in a friends backyard for a few hours, I found out yesterday someone there tested positive."
I plan to travel in a couple months.
"He claims that he has done all he can, but doesn't want to stop doing things like this and gets very aggressive when I ask him to consider if he ends up dying he is going to leave me and my 10 year old brother behind."
"One of the unvaccinated people just today took a covid home test, and it was positive."
"Well the summer is almost over and Ive got no idea what to do anymore except that this is probably never going to end, so I figured schould I go to some events now that Im fully vaccinated or just give up and only work on my self from now on."
"25M 2 doses of <ORG>, I am approaching 6 months and worried that my vaccine isn't going to hold up and I am get a breakthrough."
"They want our family to meet up (including my parents, over 65) today, and say that it has been 10 days that they've isolated and they feel better so not to worry."
They may be farther out from market ready than I feel comfortable waiting.
"The way I see it is that there's a way out, a societal goal to be achieved but since many people who could really need the vaccine are refusing to take it, we still are asked/made... to take precautions. <SEP> Why won't some people tell the whole story? <SEP> Too low vaccination rates are our problem that is holding us back from returning to normality! <SEP> I wish people would extend their narrative by this one point."
"I keep reading online about people dying after their first/second and even if i know that those are clickbait articles, i'm afraid that my anxiety will be unbearable after the treatment."
"Just wanted to see what you guys out there have been able to do to help and support your loved one in this situation, what did you do help them mentally?"
Can someone point me towards some research on breakthrough cases and what the long term effects look like?
"I also keep reminding myself that if she caught covid, it would be much more worrying. <SEP> A vaccine is much safer than catching covid."
"My question is, is there any test that he can take that can tell if he is still infectious and what does the science say about testing positive after a 14 day quarantine. <SEP> How long could he be infectious?"
I'm hoping that's the case since Wisconsin is now the next place to get hit with the Delta surge and I'm praying that it won't be like last year where it was me at my wits end dreading everyday going into work fearing that I would get infected.
"But by some glitch, I was also marked as vaccinated with the covishield version's first dose when my wife got her second dose mid September."
The Senior WHO expert said and hope the pandemic can end in 2022:[[url] She say that they have the tools now and she also said by the mid 2022 the global vaccination will finally reach 70% vaccination rate.
Yet every article I've seen about what normal life looks like in 2022 acts like mask wearing will be in place every fall-winter for the rest of our lives.
"Im thinking that instead of spending the night at our friends, we only go for the party Saturday, stay masked the whole time, and keep an eye out for the PCR results that should come that day."
"As I understand it, I have some type of immunity for a while because I had it so recently, so what types of precautions do I need to take? <SEP> Can I sleep in the same bed as her? <SEP> Do I also need to quarantine?"
"If the coming January-February is gonna be the same as the previous one even with the vaccines and new treatments, what's the guarantee that January 2023, 2024 or 2030 won't be the same?"
(Boostered six weeks ago) I'm supposed to be at work in four hours and ordered a <ORG> test for store pickup. <SEP> Are these pretty accurate?
"But despite the news of a significantly lower hospital and death rate, antiviral medications on the way and the effectiveness of a booster shot it seems like some countries (hello Netherlands) are back in March 2020 panic mode and tbh I'm just very confused at whats actually going on - is this somewhat a media-provoked overreaction, a careful precaution for the long-expected winter surge or something more worse going on?"
Are some people just untouchable or what ?
Went to the ER and was told it was Conjunctivitis (pink eye) then I got to reading about how something like 3% of covid patients have it. <SEP> I've never heard this. <SEP> Is it cause for worry?
Even The director general of the WHO is committed to ending the pandemic in 2022.
what should i do? <SEP> should i only be concerned if i exhibit symptoms? <SEP> should i continue to wear a mask around the house?
"Were all vaccinated and my parents are planning to get tested in the next couple of days. <SEP> Based on this info, do you guys think its alright for me to go back?"
Now Im just afraid of another lockdown taking this all away from me.
Did anyone else go through this and how long did it take for your hearing to come back.
I am wondering how long to wait until taking a rapid test I bought last night.
I have been without fever or hard chills / aches for over 24 hours and on day 6 of my omicron journey. <SEP> Is it safe to assume I'm in the clear regarding tough symptoms?
"I dont try new foods, medicines, anything because of the fear of having an allergic reaction."
It seems like I can even make an appointment if the 6 month period hasn't passed yet... is it possible to get the booster before 6 months?
"I mean, the cases have been surging because of the Omicron and Ive heard there will be more variants coming."
This is the case with my SO and I was wondering how well protected he is when it comes to omicron now since he had a infection with delta (PCR confirmed) only 5 weeks ago.
I know no one knows the answer to this but if one of you can share a bit of positivity or even just your own opinion that would be great!
So my family runs a small local restaurant in North Carolina that is currently experiencing a massive Covid crush at the moment. <SEP> They had a nye party planned with about 100-150 guests reserved. <SEP> Now my family seems pretty upset and I feel a lot of shame for not being involved but my heart just says that this is a bad idea and not the ethical thing to do at this moment in time yet I still just cant shake the feeling that I am the one in the wrong here.
"I have already called out from work and scheduled a lab test, I'm just unable to get in for a few days and wondering what result I should be expecting to see."
Has anyone felt like this in recovery?
"Now, with the virus being utterly unavoidable, they will die and I will be left alone."
Am I selfish for still going to the gym and eating out with my partner?
Maybe test before and after the trip as extra precautions?
"I have the usual symptoms such as headache and loss of taste and smell, but Ive also been experiencing some not so common symptoms as well and would like some feedback to see if there are others who have experienced it as well."
Would it be safe to assume I likely have covid since a lot of my symptoms line up with omicron?
"If exposed symptomatic employees are quarantined, and if I wear my KN95 mask/try to keep my distance away from everyone, would it be safe for me to work my shifts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday?"
Does anyone else feel so afraid of being isolated due to COVID and what better ways are there to cope staying in one small room all day or for future quarantines?
Anyone else have this interesting combination?!
"I would accept these test results, but my two shift mates at work both tested positive with identical symptoms that developed at the same time as mine."
Should I postpone the trip to February til things calm down?
Is this just a bad cold? <SEP> Should I bother taking another rapid and/or PCR?
"I know this is a question often asked, but I'm looking for actual first hand accounts of how long it took you or a friend / partner / family member to test negative on a PCR test after you initially had symptoms, in days if possible."
"If youve had covid for 8 days and no major symptoms, is it likely to stay a mild case?"

Any advice on exercising with Covid?
To what extent am I protected from long covid if I catch omicron?
I'm convinced that it will make me very unwell.
if anyone has experience with this kind of combination of vaccines pls let me know if you felt okay.
"My question is this: is there any sense in having my partner isolate in a bedroom here at my house given that yesterday we were kissing, had sex, etc.?"
I was sick in December with maybe-covid so I'm wondering if that has anything to do with my body's unhappy reaction today.
I agree with that. <SEP> He still thinks the pandemic can end this year provided we vaccinate more in the world. <SEP> That I agree with.
He has had to go to the ER for a breathing treatment with flu before.
"She's worried that it will be long term or permanent, anyone have any insight?"
Anyone know if well have treatments for this down the line?
"How worried should I be? <SEP> Is this normal? <SEP> I'm only getting my tests done tomorrow, anything you'd recommend?"
I feel like I have no metric for what's appropriate to worry about.
"Should I get the booster, knowing that I experienced these symptoms?"
I've gone back to work after being on sick leave for 2 weeks but I'm wondering if I should stay at home a little bit longer.
"I think it's almost unavoidable that we catch this virus, despite her now staying in her room."
"But I can't help but have this gut feeling that it's far too soon to do away with mask mandates, mostly because they did that last summer and then delta happened."
When will it end so I can go outside again?
"I always get mixed up with calendars for some reason. <SEP> According to the CDC it should be ""2-dose series separated by 21 days"" [[url] but this only looks like 20 days between doses."
Posted few days ago about being nervous about 2nd pfizer dose and appreciate everyones advice and feedback just want to give some updates for those interested or nervous as well.
"Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced?"
Im hoping someone here might be able to drop some knowledge?
Should I wait to see how this delta variant plays out the next coming weeks?
Will i be okay if i go now or should i wait for the 2 weeks so they are fully vaccinated. <SEP> Will it be significantly less safe if i go now?
I have a question about the delta variant. <SEP> Ive been hearing people that <ORG> and astra vaccines are effective against the delta variant.
The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone.
Should I be concerned?
So I want to know if any you know where I can get masks that are migraine/sensory friendly? <SEP> While still doing the job a normal medical mask does.
"Im just wondering what this means on a larger scale, if someone could please help clear this up."
Does anybody what my risk of catching it would be? <SEP> More specifically the Delta variant?
Anyone been vaccinated shortly after covid or have any advice?
What are my options? <SEP> Is it okay to take <ORG> or <ORG> as the second dose?
"Do I really have to be worried? <SEP> When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow?"
"Is it just another pathetic attempt of fearmongering, which media can't catch a break from, or should I really be worried about another lockdown coming in fall?"
How likely will it put things back to square one? <SEP> Will I be put in another lockdown and forced to wear a mask again?
I had my first dose (<ORG>) a little over a month ago and I'd like to get my 2nd shot a bit sooner than what is scheduled. <SEP> However most are <ORG> now.
If there is research along these lines then I it saying it is not possible to spread through groceries/deliveries or that it is simply a lower chance.
Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home?
Just wondering if anyone who had covid while fully vaccinated would mind sharing what it was like?
"Another question, regarding washing whats the best way to deal with that as I can't find anything that could help that issue."
My mother is aged and smokes a lot and my country is in the middle of a covid delta variant spike so I need a high degree of protection.
"Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying."
"hi, i wrote about the first dose and i thought some of you might be interested in the ""trip report"" after the second dose of sputnik, so here i am."
"The particular mask available to me for purchase is valved, but I'm thinking I can just cover the valve with something solid so as to protect people from me in case I am/become infected. <SEP> Correct me if I'm wrong."
Do you think its reasonable to expect things will end up getting worse again because of this variant?
"Its bigger than covid - once we get through this, society is gonna be permanently changed and I wouldnt be surprised if this results in either civil war in the US or some sort of world war. <SEP> And climate change is gonna accelerate and were just going to let it happen and well all die."
"I encourage everyone to think about someone in your life right now who is unvaccinated but just might need a steady hand to hold to get them down off the fence, and try for them, if you have the mental energy for it."
"Last I heard the airplanes are requiring them until at least September, but they are not guaranteeing an extension nor a early ending."
Is there any data indicating that having no or very little side effects from a vaccination is correlating to break through infections?
"Given how many people in America refuse to be vaccinated, it seems likely that we'll soon have a mutation that evades the current vaccines."
"I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired."
Does anyone have anecdotal stories for convincing anti-vaxxers or even just lazy people to get the vaccine?
"An observation that I noticed today: both New Jersey and New York's rate of transmissions both creeked over 1, but the case numbers in both cases are still nowhere near winter surge levels."
"I still believe it can happen by the end of the year, especially when the kids get their vaccines."
"My partner and I are both double vaxxed - he got covid, however i haven't tested positive but I had 3-4 days of feeling very rough (kind of like a head cold with a sore throat, dizzyness) Could this be my body fighting off covid rather than getting infected?"
"Unvaccinated individuals in Washington state all have to wear masks in public, and while vaccinated individuals don't, the CDC website doesn't really go into broad descriptions on my specific concerns in their FAQ's section."
There are still Latinos and others who have yet to receive the shot. <SEP> There is still a good chance that this will all be over by the end of the year.
"Having just watched the newest COVID-19 Meeting, I can say that we are in the very least a far better position to fight the virus than we were a year ago."
With the 'normal' virus the chances of a breakthrough are supposed to be very low (one in thousands). <SEP> I assume it's different with Delta.
I want to see more people take the vaccine and have us end this pandemic.
Ive read in some places that even if theres a surge in cases that there wont be another lockdown.
Has anyone had to go do some emergency dental work during the pandemic?
"Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. <SEP> The more people we do this to, the better."
thanks and I hope we'll all get over this pandemic as soon as possible
Is it illegal to hide a diagnosis froma patient that is life threatening.
"I just want to know which vaccines are considered ""accepted"" to enter to the US from another country."
"According to what I have been seeing from <PERSON>'s Twitter, there seem to be instances of vaccinations slowly but surely trickling up from the past week."
"And of those people, 345k are getting their first."
\--- Since writing this yesterday I've started to have some trouble breathing and 2 instances of coughing up white mucus.
"Therefore, I want to ask you guys to share your own story that is new to you after covid 19."
Best case is some sort of forever yearily seasonal lockdowns or social distancing/mask mandates out of this after God knows how many years of vaccines waning too fast to end this Pandemic.
He is due to start again as an employee hopefully next weekend (I stopped seeing him during the pandemic but started the process of hiring him again once he got the vaccine).
"I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen."
"Who has already done that? <SEP> How was your experience, both getting it and with side effects?"
"There may have been people who are saying vaccinations alone isn't enough, but so far we are making good progress."
what are the chances of it happening and if it does happen on what day should i expect it after vaccination.
"I am supposed to go to two conventions in August and October, and cases are projected to peak in October."
"I doubt people will mask up for the flu every single season, though. <SEP> I just don't expect it all, depending where I live."
I am starting to think that maybe people like me and certain members of my family may just not be susceptible to covid.
"I feel slightly better today, my temp is finally below 99 so maybe that's why."
"I've also looked at the piece of paper the nurse handed me, as well as the NHS, US CDC, and other reliable resources. <SEP> It all seems very clinical which I usually prefer, but not in this instance."
We are looking to find a company/website that sells covid rapid tests in bulk.
"Anyone whos gotten a booster shot, what can you tell me about side effects? <SEP> Are they worse than they were after your initial vaccination, or are they better?"
"If yes, do you see as many companies enforcing it or other travel restrictions for the 3rd shot?"
"Im not giving up hope of the end of the pandemic or going doom and gloom again, but I just dont understand what I did wrong or maybe I just dont understand."
Would it be safe to go to Steel City Con even if I haven't gotten a booster yet?
"I have listed the products that seem most likely to be beneficial here. <SEP> I have done some rudimentary research to make this short list, but would appreciate knowing if some or all of these pass your own bar of research."
"It seems AnimeNYC taught officials a lesson. <SEP> People are telling us to ""seriously reconsider our plans."""
"But it shows that the more we keep doing what we're doing, we'll end this pandemic."
"I have been invited to a wedding that will happen 8 days after my 2nd dose of the vaccine is scheduled, would it be a good idea to attend the wedding? <SEP> As far as I know, the attendees won't need to be vaccinated or be told to wear masks, how much risk will I be putting myself in if I choose to attend?"
Right now I'm getting concerned that music festivals and other social gatherings could get shutdown again thanks to the omicron variant. <SEP> Out in NYC they had an anime convention where a ton of people caught omicron and I feel like that could lead to cancelation of social gatherings again.
I havent been able to find a timeline about how the symptoms for breakthrough covid come on. <SEP> Are the fatigue and headaches apart of the incubation period or are these legitimate symptoms?
Is it safe to get a potential root canal right now?
What would you do in this situation? <SEP> Has anyone else felt like this?

I'm Zooming every day with whomever feels like they need a place to speak their thoughts - anonymously if you prefer.
I'm feeling slight twinges of pain in my heart every now and then. <SEP> Was wondering if this was normal for anyone who received the <ORG> booster.
And I presume there be another variant called Pi after the Omicron.
"When I heard that, I became immediately hopeful."
"So for my first post back if anyone needs support or just someone to talk to in general, ask questions etc. <SEP> i will respond to anyone."
Does anybody have any experience with PCR testing that can give me some advice as to whether Ill test positive?
So I'm starting to feel that 2022 might be another bad year as 3030 and 2021.
"Then if we arranged for a few days earlier we would need to get pre-depature PCR tests on Christmas Day itself which seems grim. <SEP> If we went earlier, like next week, our boosters would not have kicked in. <SEP> And there could be a lockdown or travel bans/quarantines coming in any day between now and when we would return. <SEP> It is all round not a great idea with Omicron because me and my in-laws are all high risk."
The new world is just gonna be way less social and everything from therapy to office work is just gonna be online.
I honestly feel like we are never going to make this hurdle but I have to remember that the sun always peaks through the clouds.
"I know this pandemic will end, but despite of the Omicron is mild, the cases are rising up and my stupid Governor reimposing the mask mandates again."
"If the people doing my makeup and styling my hair wear masks, how safe would I actually be?"
Apparently it's likely gonna be around the middle of this decade before every country hits their vax goals which means more variants are probably gonna pop up and spread.
I said dont worry the summer will be amazing when were all vaccinated.
Just wanting some similar stories with good outcomes maybe? <SEP> And the time line to expect with this fever?
