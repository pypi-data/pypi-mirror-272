"Four months ago, I had a big family reunion."
We haven't had one in over 20 years.
This was a very exciting event.
There were plenty of steaks to go around the whole family.
We had a family reunion about 4 months ago that was a really great time.
I got to see my distant family that I hadn't seen in decades since I was a kid and close ones that I rarely see.
He also lives on the opposite coast so it is just hard to meet up.
He was looking in pretty good health about the same as when he left so that was good to see considering all the time that has passed.
I hope everyone gets to meet up with their family at some point because in the end it's all that you have and you don't want to waste that.
It was our first ever family reunion and it was really cool.
We weren't able to really do this before besides random holiday meet ups sporadically so it really was a nice change of pace.
I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family.
Absolutely not.
"I feel that the most appropriate thing for you to do would be to call the bride and explain your situation, and offer to have them over or take them out when your situation improves."
it was an nice experience i had ever.
they both are made for each other.
we are childhood friends.
"I had been sick,throwing up for the past few days and very tired."
I haden't a clue what the problem could be.
After much thought I went ahead and purchased a pregnancy test and took it.
Anxiously waiting for the results  my whole world was rocked.
"I was completely confused,terrified,shocked,amazed &a thousand other things."
But this time would be much different.
I would be all alone.
My mother was gone.
"Due to stage 4 cancer, I'd lost her just 6 months prior."
Was this her way of giving me the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.
Would I be strong enough to do this without her?
So after i found out that i would ne welcoming another little one into my life i wasn't sure how to feel.
What makes thing scary is doing it alone.
My main support system was gone.
The grandmother to my children was no more.
The one i needed when no one else was there .
was gone.
It doesn't make 9t easier though.
I really loved being able to get together and learn more about art.
I always love to observe art on the streets or in museums but 3 weeks ago I got to have a very cool art experience.
Many neighbors came together to paint a mural in the middle of the intersection.
It was my first time to pain on a street and the first time to paint a ten foot manatee.
We chose the manatee because it is the elementary school's mascot.
I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration.
I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools.
My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out.
What I love about painting the street is that it is easy to just make corrections immediately without having to wait much.
I think I may try using acrylics next time I am in front of the canvas.
It was a hot day in July that our community decided to paint a mural on an intersection for public art.
I had decided to volunteer to help paint.
"As I ate my donut, I noticed a couple chickens crossing the road."
I was told that they lived on the block.
It took a couple hours but it looked great.
"A young girl, who was visiting the neighborhood, asked to help paint."
It was a fun time painting the manatee.
"The outline of the manatee looked really bad at this point, so I got some black paint and went over the entire outline having to change some of what we had previously painted."
The sun was starting to come up and it was going to be a very hot day but the fun of painting in the street helped to make you forget all of that.
I soon finished with the help of others the sun beams.
A young girl was wanting to help paint too so I offered to share the manatee.
She had a great time helping.
I had to re-paint the lines that outlined the manatee since they were a little off.
It looked amazing and I had a great feeling to know that I could drive by the mural and see my manatee that we painted.
I'm still so angry at mom for not admitting she's wrong!
I finally got the courage to tell her how her hitting me when I was younger really affected me and she still feels like she's justified in it.
Especially when it was for something so dumb like not cleaning my room.
Sometimes I just hate her.
"Just say, oops I made a big mistake and it wont happen again."
My cousin told me my mom is coming to town next week.
Of course when i said no I was made out to be the bad guy again.
When I was finally ready to give her a chance that went all the way left.
I asked her how did I get burned why do i have what looks like cigarette marks on my body ?
My mom is coming to town everybody keeps telling me .
I remember I asked her one year about my childhood and she said God has already forgiven me for the things that have happened to you.
Three months ago I lost a job that paid minimum wage.
That's how I found myself homeless.
"My eyes now  follow their peaceful smiles, their kids full of crisp laughter as they casually walk about the grounds."
That's very different than being me who is now a drifter who never dreams anymore.
I hold onto my faith fiercely hoping a miracle might come along.
I recently came to the realization that most of what I believed in life was a lie.
A short time ago though I realized that this was not the life for me.
Of course I realized this too late.
"So, in need of some relief, I traveled to south Florida to see an old friend."
There is a scene in the movie 'Office Space' that really strikes home.
"In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life."
I feel him.
"I now find myself thinking about this each day, planning how I might change things, trying to find the courage to become the person I want to be, to live the life I have always wanted."
"October, I feel you."
I'll promise to read more.
"A few classics, a few books for guilty pleasures."
Get healthy and have more energy for my kids when I get home.
I'll promise to volunteer.
"Leaving the world a better place, making connections with those around me, doing good when no one is looking."
I'll make promises to travel more.
"This is never really a promise, but a reminder that life is short, the world is small, and if I do not put time aside to see new places 'that day' will never come."
"So, October, I guess I am glad to see you."
You are my first step in winter to a new year.
I have been unlucky with love for much of my life.
It's crazy because the same can be said for my friend Megan.
Megan and I went to college together and lived in the same apartment complex for three years.
It's funny but we just never seemed to be single at the same time.
Then one night we were out with another friend at a bar together and joked about how we should just give up looking for a partner and date each other.
It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads.
Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together.
We hit it off perfectly.
"We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense."
We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other.
"This only happened a month ago, but we still have yet to inform some of our good friends."
But sometimes that can be inevitable with a big group of friends like we have.
I know right now that Megan and I seem like a perfect match.
"Hopefully we will last and can continue to have fun together, regardless of what our friends say."
She's an old girlfriend of mine.
And I'm sponsoring her in a twelve-step program.
We hadn't seen each other face-to-face in years.
"When she showed up, we immediately started flirting."
She ended up staying the night.
We became romantically involved even though both of us sort of knew better.
But we've been doing great since.
"It was worth the risk, we both agreed."
"I must admit, the 'wrong' nature of what we did sort of made it more appealing."
I think she would agree with that.
I am a recovering alcoholic and she is a recovering codependent.
People of the same gender aren't supposed to sponsor one another in 12-Step programs.
But I ended up sponsoring her.
But being that close to someone and watching her grow and learn to be happy and care for herself made me sort of fall in love with her.
I told her about my feelings and we started dating.
But we became romantically involved anyway.
We have more or less proved everyone wrong.
"We are very happy, and, to be honest, we are one of the healthiest couples I know."
"I have high hopes for us, and she does, too."
"Four months ago, I had a wild time going to a family wedding."
I talked to my sister and she has gotten a job in a big advertising firm.
I talked to my brother and he just graduated college with a job prospect.
My older brother is getting married to a rich tycoon woman.
He will be very happy with the mansion he is moving into.
I hope his life will have meaning.
I threw up on my older brother.
The event was my nephew Jimmy and Adriennes wedding.
It was a destination wedding.
I was not too far away.
We were able to drive there in 4 hours.
Quite a few guests did travel via airlines.
It was the first time in almost 10 years all my extended family was planning to get together.
He brought  his serious girlfriend Cristal.
This wedding was at a beautiful bed and breakfast.
The weather was gorgeous.
This was my nephew's wedding.
"The wedding was at a wonderful venue, a romantic B&B with a stunning setting."
One of the shocking events was watching my cousin (female) smoking a cigar with the men.
Then to top it off her mom who was 70+ comes out and takes the cigar from her and takes a few puffs on it.
My wife and I actually were thinking that we last saw them when my wife was pregnant with our 12 year old daughter.
It was the first time I actually danced at a formal event with my daughter.
"Before long over 20 years passed and I realized something was missing, I wanted a Masters degree, it never left my mind."
The opportunity was present and I am so glad I finally took it.
"But what really matters on this special day is not only proving to myself I could do it, but showing my Daughter to never give up."
"The pride I feel inside from accomplishing my goal, but the feeling of completeness there is from my Daughter receiving her Masters the same day is indescribable."
"The told me continuously to start classes, to get moving on it, at times there were almost relentless about it."
"I could see it in their eyes, how very much they wanted me to complete my education, I felt that drive in them, that sense of pride they would have in me."
"Before they passed away I made a promise, to me I took an oath in their presence, that I would no matter what complete my Masters degree."
"They never let me forget that promise, my mother reminded me of it daily, my father talked about it often and I carried that around with me until this day."
"At first she could not grasp the meaning of it all to me, the sense of gratitude I had for my parents as well as what it meant to them for me to get my higher level degree."
"It brought me great happiness to be able to share the day with her, to get a degree the same time she did."
"The sun was shining, it was warm and there wasn't a cloud in the sky."
This day would be a day that would forever change my life.
I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal.
Today was the day that I would receive my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering.
This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier.
"Well, that time came 2 years ago when I took the step of enrolling in school at the age of 46."
Did I need the Masters degree?
Would it change my life?
Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful?
I mainly did it to keep a promise that I made to my parents when I had started my Family.
It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it.
Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here?
"What made this even more special is that I would receive my Degree alongside of my Daughter who on the exact day, was receiving her Masters degree in Chemical Engineering."
I don't know what caused the sudden surge of emotions but part of me felt my parents right there on the stage with me.
"During my senior year and just before entering the Master's program, my girlfriend was pregnant."
I was happy because I was going to be a father but upset because I would not be able to get my Master's degree.
My parents were devastated and i'm sure that they were hurt.
My girlfriend and I decided to marry and raise our child before returning to school.
I continually put it off until one day that I promised my parents that I would go back to school.
The day came when my daughter received her Bachelor's degree in Biology and we made a pact to get our Master's degree together and that we were going to do it for her Grandpa and Grandma.
"On the day of graduation, before the commencement, I sat in the car with my Wife and silently cried."
I was so proud of my daughter and I knew that 2 other people were looking down on me with the same pride.
But I can't help but feel a bit of residual stress as I think over how I almost ruined it for her.
"Maybe that's dramatic, but I felt like I was ruining things when I spilled my champagne down the front of my bridesmaid's gown when she was counting on me to just show up and be presentable."
"Of course,  she wasn't mad at me in the end (maybe that's because we got it cleaned up), but the stress and embarrassment I felt was crazy."
"I haven't been to many big events like that lately, and I was freaking out."
"But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman."
Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out.
"It took her no time at all to make my dress good as new, and the weight just instantly lifted off my chest."
"Four months ago, my cousin got married."
The most memorable moment was when I spilled champagne on my dress before the wedding.
"Thankfully, one of the girl's mom was a dry cleaner and immediately took the dress to get the stain out."
"Dear diary, about 6 months ago my cousin got married."
"There was a lot of people in a tight space, so, I bumped into someone and spilled champagne entirely down my blush gown!"
We called my Aunt to come in and she immediately had me take off the dress.
"After that, she held the dress under a dryer."
"Miraculously, the stain came out and it dried in time."
The wedding went on without a hitch.
3 week ago my dog passed away and I was not there to see her go.
I knew that my dog Shelly was sick and that she was in the hospital but I thought I would make it in time.
She got me through the school transfer in 6th grade and was my rock.
I couldn't believe it when I got the call that she was in the hospital because she stopped eating.
I prayed that she would hold on long enough so that I could drive back after finals and see her one last time and tell her how much she meant to me.
"On the way there Mom called, and gave me the news."
I had to pull over on the side of the road I was crying so hard.
Thank you Shelly.
"Three weeks ago, my dog died."
I was not there.
"In the middle of the night, my only real option as a non-driver was Greyhound."
"When I got there, I was denied the ability to board."
My identification had recently expired.
"I felt profoundly hopeless, hysterical, self-loathing, and broken."
"As it turned out, I would not have made it."
My dog went sometime in her sleep in the night before I would have arrived.
My parents had her cremated.
I still haven't been able to go back home.
"Over the summer, I was in another state visiting family."
"For one reason or another, I chose not to."
"The next day, my mom informed me that my dog was not doing well."
"Immediately, I knew I had to try to get back."
"While trying to board, I was denied access because my identification had expired since I left town."
I was profoundly crushed.
"However, I woke up to a text from my mom saying that my dog had not made it through the night."
I always knew my boyfriend was a liar.
But two months ago I was at my wit's end.
That's when I knew.
"He drove for just five miles, to a subdivision nowhere close to where his friends live."
Once he pulled into a random driveway a young girl wearing a leather jacket came out and got in his car.
They passionately kissed and accelerated off into the night.
I didn't bother to follow them.
"A couple months ago, I was involved in an incident where I found out that my boyfriend was cheating on me."
"I was out to dinner with him at a relatively nice restaurant, and I noticed that he would not stop checking his phone."
"I had noticed that he had done this occasionally in the weeks preceding this event, but it had not been to this extent."
"I have a hard time executing confrontations, but I decided that enough was enough and I should definitely say something to him."
"When we left the restaurant and began driving home, he told me that he was going to drop me off at my house."
"I kissed him and said by like usual, but as soon as he pulled out of my driveway and left, I got in my car and proceeded to follow him."
"I tried to remain as discrete as possible, and I wound up following him to a house that wasn't his."
"I was him go inside, and I immediately knew that something was wrong."
"I got out of my car, knocked on the door, and when a woman answered the door, I immediately turned around got back in my car and went home."
"Since this event has happened, I have since reconciled with my boyfriend."
"I was incredibly angry and upset with him at first, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him."
"Eventually, I gave in, and we are now back together."
"I do sometimes get feelings of suspicion or feelings that he is going to cheat on me once again, but I try to see past those feelings because I know that he really loves me."
"It has not been easy, but I still love him and care about him, and I am trying to make this work the best that I can."
"Three months ago, I graduated college... finally."
"I had my master's under my belt, teaching credentials in line."
I was able to get a cushy job at a private school for all grades K-12.
"The pay was okay, but it was more about finally being able to do what I love, what I spent so long trying to achieve."
"Unfortunately, we took budget cuts."
"I was the last hired, so I was the first fired."
"I had to accept a teaching job at a public school after getting used to my dreamy, safe, private school job."
"The pay is horrendous, it's almost like the government doesn't want kids to learn anything."
"I had to buy most of the supplies, and some of the kids are so poor, I ended up having to buy supplies for the kids to even be able to learn."
I thought my student loans were bad... these credit card bills as a public school teacher may kill me before I even get a chance to get a raise in 10 years.
"I feel like I am right where I am supposed to be, helping these kids."
Even if I end up having to get a part-time job on top of this to make ends meet.
The event that was most memorable and striking to me within the last few months was graduating with my teaching credential and master's degree.
To finally be done with my credential and master's was a huge accomplishment for me.
"That is, unless I decide to go back for my doctorate degree."
When I graduated with my credential and master's degree it was June.
"However, there were not very many teaching jobs available during this time period."
This meant that I only had one job interview during that time.
"Unfortunately, I was the runner up for that position."
This is not as good of a job due to financial concerns.
You are not able to establish the same types of relationships with students that you can in your own classroom.
It was surprising to me how bad the job market has been considering the news is constantly saying that there is a teacher shortage.
My substitute teaching job is not enough to cover these loans.
I think that they should be more honest with the state of the teacher job market.
"Just four months ago, my daughter married her long time boyfriend."
I always knew they would get married but it was still kinda surprising and emotional when they announced it.
The wedding itself was just a small family affair that happened at the court house with a celebration afterwards.
One of the best things about this wedding is that my son came and he and my daughter got to be reunited with each other.
They've been arguing and hostile with each other for the past five years so this was kinda a big deal.
I was so glad to see them finally reconcile with each other because it's been a huge strain for me having them fighting with each other.
So this was a big deal to me and made the wedding all the more meaningful.
"I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up."
I saw him talking to my daughter later that night at our house and I expected it to get heated but to my surprise they were laughing and smiling.
Turns out from what he told me later they both apologized to each other and decided life was too short to continue arguing.
Now I can't wait to become a grandmother.
My daughter finally married her long-time boyfriend.
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
She needed to be on his insurance but she had just quit her job.
"But it was very legitimate, too."
Everyone showed up in cutoffs or bathing suits and sandals or bare feet.
The way she looked at him when exchanging vows was precious.
"Honestly, the best part though was that my daughter and son reconnected."
She asked him to be a witness.
He was very honored to accept.
My daughter finally married her longtime boyfriend.
I vividly remember the look on her face.
They ended up disappearing off together for about an hour.
"My daughter's new husband was like, 'Where is my wife?'"
My heart is utterly broken.
"Two months ago in May, my sister-in-law passed away."
It was sudden and very tragic.
She was driving home from work in the rain when she lost control of her car and get into an accident on the interstate.
"I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February."
I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are.
"This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives."
My family is pulling through as best we can and are making sure that we are there for each other in this trying time.
"The funeral was difficult, but it was attended by so many people and my sister-in-law would've really been happy to know how many lives she touched when she was still here."
I come from a very large family (I'm the youngest of 7) and there were 10 of us total who attended the concert.
It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT.
It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough.
"Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert."
She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.
She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.
She passed away that night.
We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.
"After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go."
His oldest son took her place.
It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed.
She had some health issues in her adult life.
She was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in her 40's.
She had surgery on her neck a few months before she passed away.
She was scheduled to have knee replacement surgery before she passed away.
She was having a normal day on the day she passed away.
She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.
She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee.
My brother found her a few minutes later and called an ambulance.
She was basically on life support from that time until she passed away about 8 hours later.
I miss her smile and I miss her laugh.
She had the best laugh!
It was a hot summer day in April.
My phone rang and I didn't recognize the number.
I decided to pick it up today  because I wasn't that busy.
It was my step-father.
He wanted to see how I was doing even though we hadn't spoken in several years.
Growing up we had a rocky relationship.
We never really got along and argued a lot.
Sometimes our arguments turned physical.
But now that we were on the phone our conversation was calm.
A memorable event that happened to me within the past few months was being contacted by my step-father.
Recently he called me out of the blue.
We had a long conversation and reconnected.
It felt really good to be able to bond with my step-father again.
I was glad to find out that he's in good health despite being in his 70s.
An unfortunate thing I found out while talking to him was that his younger sister passed away from cancer.
We've since talked a couple more times.
The memorable event that I shared was when my step-father got in touch with me after a long time of us not speaking to each other.
My biological dad left when I was a baby so my step-dad was pretty much the sole father figure in my life during some of my formative years (around age four to nine).
This was until he and my mom unfortunately got divorced.
So my step-dad apparently got my phone number from my mom and gave me an unexpected call one day several months ago.
"He also told me about his health, which he's had issues with at times, but on the whole things are going pretty well for him especially considering he's in his 70s."
He told me he has a new wife who he said is great and he's very happy being with.
The memorable and rather shocking part of the story was when that my step-dad told me his younger sister had died (only in her 50s) far too soon from cancer.
My dad passed away last month.
"I knew he was sick, but it was still such a shock."
He used to work in Detroit.
"Well, He got cancer behind one of his kidneys."
"As I was cleaning up the house afterwards, a lawyer showed up."
Ni biggie.
Yesterday a huge check showed up from dad. Huge.
Five months ago I was still mourning and healing from the abrupt death of my mother who died late last year.
She was my best friend.
She was married to my father for 42 years and he was heartbroken over her death.
Five months ago he died from that broken heart.
I was  such an emotional wreck over their deaths that I went into auto pilot.
Exactly 3 weeks after his death I started receiving settlement checks in the mail from a lawsuit he had just finished.
It turns out that my father was awarded settlements from a lawsuit at the time of his death.
As the executor of his estate the funds went to me.
I was floored.
The 12 checks were made out to me and had my father as reference.
After the untimely death of father I continued to close accounts and handle issues that arose in the estate.
I was ecstatic and very surprised when I received the 12 checks in the mail from the lawyer.
It was bitter sweet that I inherited my family home I grew up in so soon.
Nonetheless it was mine now.
I came across the legal paperwork for a case in which my father was awarded money.
It was the case in which I received the 12 checks from.
As I went through the paperwork I realized the 12 checks were just the tip of the iceberg.
There were a list of payments that were to be made to my father and now to me.
I was astounded.
My parents had been working on this case for years.
The lawyer explained that this would be ongoing and I would receive many more payments for years to come.
I am finally a college graduate!
"After graduation, my family decided to go on a vacation to Zion National Park."
"I can't believe that in all my years of going to college in Utah, I had never made it to Zion."
"It was an exciting trip, since I just graduated from college."
"Also, the bus ride up to the trails was fascinating, especially seeing the variety of different locations."
"I had just finished my degree in Character Animation, and I was ready to celebrate with my family."
"It had been months since I had last seen them, and it was exciting that we were all coming together to celebrate."
"Due to the rain, we had less of a selection of trails, but we still made the most of the trip."
"Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long."
"I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then."
It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.
"As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding."
All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.
The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.
So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.
I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.
It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.
"I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee."
"Even though I'm feeling defeated, I'm also feeling oddly hopeful too."
I was holding on to my urine a lot for four weeks because i was didn't want to let go of the online games i was playing.
I noticed that i couldn't control my bladder and the frequency of going to the bathroom was increasing.
I was scared for my life.
"If i didn't go the bathroom once my body called for, my urinary tract would start hurting."
I never had pain like this in my urinary tract before.
I couldn't/can't do the normal things i once did.
Like go on a run for 30 minutes because i would be wanting to urgently go the bathroom in between my run.
I went to the my annual physical doctor and she didn't know what kind of treatment i needed.
My primary doctor gave my phone number to the best specialist at the hospital.
It took weeks to see a urinary specialist.
"I don't know the exact length, but i had to wait a couple of weeks just so he can hear my side of the story and see what steps he can take with me."
But it didn't.
"I took them and turned my pee to a blue color, which on the package, it said that it was normal."
"But it didn't cure my frequent urination, which is what i'm going through right now."
What the urinary specialist told me was they're going to ultra sound my kidneys.
Then they're going to look inside my urine hole while i'm under anesthesia.
What a wild ride this life has been so far.
"The ups, the downs and everything in between."
I bought the ring five months before I actually asked her.
"Finally, after all that, I popped the question."
I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.
And she said yes!
"She actually said yes, the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to marry me, some schmuck from Brooklyn."
We were married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.
"Everyone was there, our parents, our friends and even Elvis made an apppearance!"
About two years ago I decided to marry my girlfriend after dating for quite a long time.
The night I proposed I was very nervous and was not able to eat my food much at all which people at our table thought that in itself was very strange.
"So, I just simply asked, didnt get down on one knee or anything, but offered it to her and myself."
She said yes!
We were married later the next year and are very happy now.
I met my now wife a long time ago about 7 years to be exact and it has been great ever since.
The evening was her birthday and I got home just as the delivery man was leaving with the ring.
But not today I was able to get the ring.
She said yes!
I always knew her life would turn this way.
I was logical.
It took a very long time to realize who she really was and what her intentions were.
"I still remember the time when it dawned on me, all that she had done to me."
I remember it all sinking in.
I was disappointed.
I genuinely cared for her and it was obvious to me that it wasn't really reciprocal.
I didn't think cutting her out of my life would lead to her demise.
I never imagined it would cause her life to unravel.
"Again, I don't even know if me cutting her out of my life was what caused her life to unravel."
"When my grandparents sat me down and described how she had hit rock bottom just a week ago, I was shocked."
She never really was on the right track in life.
Her alcoholism finally caught up with her.
"How could you end up fired, in jail and confessing to alcoholism all in a matter of four days!"
Today I found out that my wife is going forward with a divorce.
"I feel like the past two years of focusing on reconciliation, was for nothing."
I also don't believe that she is thinking of the kids.
"I continue to pray for healing and restoration, but I'm losing hope."
"I know God is in control, but I am struggling."
I think about when the tragedy that struck our family just over 2 years ago and never thought it would result in our family separating.
It starts with a husband who made it terrible mistake by having an affair.
It's about a wife who found out and obviously was devastated.
This is also about a wife who cannot bring herself to forgive.
So then what happens to the family?
Our honeymoon was fantastic.
"It was not your typical honeymoon, we spent our honeymoon acting like kids, and it was great."
"We spent a large majority of our time riding our favorite rides, and just pretending we were children again."
"After Six flags, we went to Disney world in Orlando, Florida."
"While in Orlando, we stumbled upon another theme park, which was a water park."
"To be honest, we had more fun at the water park than we did at Orlando, we were there for hours!"
"Our next and last trip was in Chattanooga Tennessee, where we stumbled upon two other theme parks."
"One was definitely one of the smallest ones we have been to, but it had a lot of charm to it."
"The last one we went to, was a very massive one, almost the size of the Disney world one in Orlando."
I think our last theme park was the best one.
"After it was all said and done, we were very happy with our decisions and had a fantastic time."
My wife and I went on our honeymoon about three month ago.
"In total, we visited 5 parks and 3 major cities."
"We were supposed to visit 6 parks, but one day got rained out and we had to skip it."
"After this, we were supposed to go to Dollywood, but the rain canceled it."
They have a coaster that pulls so many G's everyone blacks out or gets close to it.
We spent three days.
I had never seen it from the Canadian side.
My wife and I were married in October 2018.
"However, because of our schedules, we couldn't go on our honeymoon until June 2019."
"Prior to the honeymoon I had some very important work due, and I was really looking forward to the time to have fun."
"We both love theme parks, and so our honeymoon was to visit six new theme parks."
They also had tons of great water rides.
"Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open."
"Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm."
The most memorable part of the Honeymoon was probably the first park.
"Three weeks ago, my life changed for the better."
"I came face-to-face with how I was truly missing out on life, on what matters most."
"Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now."
Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.
She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.
The kids were killed in that horrible accident.
My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.
"She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy."
"I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night."
I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?
"I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list."
I decided that I was tired of the same thing every day and tired of the waiting for something more when it's not possible to know how much time you have left.
I reminded myself it was time to actually live my life and that meant having more of these happy moments so I decided to get off of auto pilot and truly live.
I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it.
I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit.
"Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom."
"I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over."
For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling.
I always feel like I am not in the moment.
It's like a lightbulb went off and I realized what all I'm missing out on.
"Now, that I finally see what I've been doing I know what I have to change."
My lane partner was very vocal on the team chat on how I am very inefficient and was stealing his experience points in the game.
He did say something about how 'noob' I am and grew more and more frustrated minute by minute.
"He was killed multiple times in the early game and of course, I was blamed for it."
"Even though he was being angry at me and whenever I made I mistake I get bullied by him, he also never gave up and continued gaining experience and gold necessary for his hero to be powerful."
"The first time the enemy made a mistake and we won a team fight, I immediately congratulated our team for the great play and my other teammates were all audibly optimistic as well."
Our carry Slark at this point has considerably limited his verbal abuse and I was sure that he will cooperate once he realized we were all there to win the game.
The enemy had many more mistakes after that and we had a very satisfying comeback.
I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game.
I actually quite like his company and we enjoy our in-game banter and he actually jokes a lot with me now.
Two days ago my son was harassed at football practice by some of his teammates.
"However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy."
They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.
Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.
"He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it."
He showed the whole team the footage at practice the next day.
The entire team -except those kids of course - voted to have the brats kicked off the team for bullying and harassment.
They were also suspended from school for their behavior.
"My son, we will call him Sam, decided to play football."
"Now, Sam is a bit on the husky side, but that is truly his only downfall."
"The coaches son said some incredibly hateful things to Sam behind his back, but loudly enough  so that Sam could hear."
He was crying and so upset when all of those kids laughed and picked on him all practice.
"I talked to Sam, and he decided to stay."
"When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk."
"Sam called a time out and very loudly said, 'I tell you what, Nate."
Does it seem really smart to be mean to the one person protecting you from a monster sized kid with death in his eyes?
Do you think it makes sense to piss off someone twice your size?
"I was SO SO proud, of Sam - and then someone started clapping, and then everyone joined in."
He handled it like a champ - and since then - there have been no squabbles on that field!
"A couple of weeks ago, there was a rumor that my co-worker, John had passed away."
He was so very liked by many people.
His down to earth and jovial personality will certainly be missed.
The rumor was confirmed to us by his wife and family and everyone at worked was sad to hear the news.
We got news of the funeral.
"In fact, we heard that we would be encourage to wear jerseys of his favorite sports team."
This took some of us by surprise.
We wanted to show a formal amount of respect.
But I guess this is the way he wanted it.
It was nice to see everyone show up wearing sport jersey.
Not everyone joined in on the informal attire.
I think they felt uncomfortably overdressed.
"Ha ha ha, John was probably laughing in the casket!"
We all paid our respects during the ceremony and at the grave site.
Afterwards we were all invited to a reception at a local sports bar.
"Here, we all told our stories of John and the experiences we had with him."
I for one will remember all the good times I had with John.
"The following week at work, a number of us talked about Johns service."
Our management decided to have one day a month where we could wear our sports jerseys.
A co-worker friend recently was diagnosed with cancer.
He had been undergoing chemo and was nearing time to go home.
He suddenly caught an infection and got seriously worse and eventually passed away.
He was only 30 years old.
His funeral was just two weekends ago and many came to support his wife and children as they move on with life.
He worked for several years in multiple departments.
His smile and friendly disposition was well known and an great encouragement to many.
"He was known for greeting many with a smile and a 'Hi Boss,' which many acknowledged when remembering him."
"A very nice tribute to a good man, husband and father as well as a great co-worker."
Though the service was for his passing it was also used as a celebration of his life and those in who came where encouraged to where casual clothes to not be so formal.
He was a big Tampa Bay Buc fan so many wore their Tampa Bay Buc Jersey's to show their support and love for him.
He leaves behind a young wife of whom I worked with in a different department.
She was also very well liked.
He also leaves behind a teenage son and daughter who must now face life without their dad.
We recently attended the funeral of one of my co-workers.
After some very unexpected health problems he passed away.
"Still a young man with a young family, very sad and tragic."
Just a year prior he was healthy and working with a bright future.
"His favorite sports team was the Tampa Bay Buc's and it was suggested, not required, that those who wanted to could wear their jerseys to the memorial service."
"Probably close to two hundred friends, family and co-workers showed up at various times to show support to his wife and celebrate his shorter than expected life."
They all mingled together talking about the shortness of his life and shock of being loss so young.
"However, the crowd inside didn't match the outside gloom as though sad, they were celebratory and thankful for having known him as friend."
We meet many we hadn't seen in sometime and all we happy to see us though not under the circumstances we came for.
When he had finished we went forward and gave his wife a hug and expressed our shock and surprise at his death.
Unexpected bumps in the road that you have to deal with and move on.
You never know when life will throw one of those bumps in your path.
When I say this came out of nowhere I really mean it.
I made coffee and breakfast for myself and my girlfriend.
We normally survive on coffee and something simple to eat.
"I cooked our favorite which we, I, call egg in a hole."
"As soon as my girlfriend, or should I say ex-girlfriend by now, entered the kitchen, something felt off."
I looked at her face and got a tinge of fear.
She looked so serious when she's normally so bubbly.
First she said she needed to talk to me.
I panicked and she must have saw it because she tried to calm me.
She said that had found someone else and was no longer in love with me.
My heart sank.
"It came out of nowhere, or I missed all the signs."
My live-in girlfriend left me after 3 years just recently.
"She said it just didn't fell right, after 3 years!"
"We bought a house together (luckily I put that in my name only), adopted a dog together and I was starting to plan out our future."
"Then that rug was pulled out from underneath me, like Thanos snapping his damn finger."
Did I see it coming?
"Should I have seen it coming, yup!"
"I found out she was talking to an ex of hers, but sometimes people make mistakes."
"We found about it, and got on with life."
"So here I am, heartbroken and just me and the dog (and yes, I told her I was keeping him and there wasn't going to be a discussion about it) so what do I do."
"Because I loved her, and I loved her family, and why punish her family by making them do it."
"Fast forward to now, I'm still without most of the crap she took with her."
"One set of sheets, 1 towel, paper plates and plastic forks."
Can I though?
What do you do when she just doesn't want to be with you anymore?
"There was no fight, there was no argument, she just looks you in the face, tells you she loves you and that you are an 'amazing man', but she just doesn't feel right and wants to leave."
"I have never been more confused in all my life, HOW can I be an 'amazing man' and yet she wants to leave."
"But there it was, she had been looking at places to move behind my back for months and I guess seeing someone else as well."
"I bought my first house with this woman, adoped a dog with this woman and swore to take care of this woman (to her father) and now she wants to leave."
And now she's leaving.
My purpose for having a house and rebuilding it the way I did was there no longer.
One of the hardest things in my life.
So what to do?
So I didn't have to see it.
"They didn't know why I did most of the hard work for them, it was because they were great men and I wanted them to be my family, hell, sometimes I still do... but it just wasn't meant to be."
I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school.
My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series.
She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse.
She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse.
The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it.
Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world.
I know it may sound silly but it was quite emotional to finish what I now consider to be my favorite book.
It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case.
"I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters."
Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.
This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).
There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.
"It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend."
I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove.
"Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book."
As such the others paled in comparison.
It was a western which is outside of my normal book choices.
It was titled 'Lonesome Dove' and was written by Larry McMurtry.
'Lonesome Dove' is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.
The two main characters are Gus and McCall.
They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.
They decide to steal some cattle from Mexico and start a ranch in the northern U.S.
On of the major villains is the a really bad guy name 'Blue Duck'.
She is a 'lady of the night' but sweet just the same.
The scenery and imagery are very rich.
You need to remember this book and maybe get other books written by McMurtry.
I really miss this book -- it seemed like an old friend.
"Nine months ago, I had a little panic."
My graduation ceremony was set back.
The cause was my dry cleaner was late on delivering my cloth of the day.
it was during my graduation ceremony.
His number was not reachable.
"because that was my only option ., As i intend to look my best on this day."
I explained my ordeal and he promised to go check on my behalf .
I can never forget this day.
This even took place at my convocation party.
"I had planned to wear a particular outfits for this event just to standout.But unfortunately ,my dry-cleaner almost ruined it and that would have got me upset really."
But i was happy at the end of the day one of my friend came trough for me by making sure the outfit made it to me at the last minute .Just when i had lose hope completely.
As if that was not enough.
There were alcohol for everyone.
One of us started misbehaving and convulsing.
One of us attended to him by giving him CPR .
"after sometime , he gain consciousness ."
And planning to take him to the hospital but he refused going .
He made sure he threw-up the alcohol intake from the party.
People have always made fun of my eyes and how they look crooked.
Growing up other kids would call me 'Crooked Eyes' and tease me endlessly.
"Thinking back, I guess I struggled socially because of the way I was treated through school."
The eye doctor I visited told me that I could have surgery to have my eyes realigned.
"Despite not being able to see on the day following my surgery, I was so thrilled to finally have this procedure done."
And once everything finally healed it was absolutely unbelievable!
My eyes look normal for the first time in my life.
Now I do not have to be so self conscious about the way I look.
All those years of being teased are gone!
I can't wait to go to my 10 year high school reunion and see everyone's faces!
"About six months ago, I went to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked."
My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain.
The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were.
He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned.
"I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye."
"I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem."
"Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly."
"The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely."
The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double.
She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double.
The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery.
"Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life!"
Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed.
This is no longer a problem!
"Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated."
It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!
I was experiencing lots of eye strain and headaches and decided to go to the optometrist to get my eyes checked out.
I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma.
"As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly."
She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them.
"After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation."
The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all.
"My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader."
I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned!
I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed.
It has really changed my life in so many ways.
I am not one for bad news.
"Four months ago, I had to say goodbye to three friends in my life."
"To loose all three like that, I felt that the world was against me."
I moaned their deaths feeling suicidal.
I arrived to my Uncle's memorial service grief stricken.
My last view of my pet dog was crushing.
I am not okay with prepared or unprepared deaths.
I lost myself in these losses.
I do positive things in their memory.
In late May I lost my dog.
I still wasn't ready though.
She had been going downhill steadily but it didn't feel like enough time to prepare.
I think a part of me knew that it was coming the day before.
She was acting off and wasn't interested in much.
I had made the decision that if she didn't improve in a day I would have her euthanized.
The morning it happened I woke up and she had thrown up on the bed.
And then the next moment she was gone and I was cradling her head on my lap sobbing uncontrollably.
"I knew that my dog was doing worse that morning, but she had come around before."
She was laying on her dog bed and breathing heavily.
Just before it was time to go I told my fiance to go without me.
I laid her head on my lap.
I told her what a great dog and friend she had been.
It was only about a half hour after my fiance left.
My dogs breathing changed and she seemed agitated.
She let out a few rattling breathes and then she was gone.
"Blissfully unaware, I enjoyed the prospect of having a new infant in the family to love and spoil as only a grandmother can."
"That happiness was short-lived, however, when CPS became involved in the baby's life because of events that had happened in her mother's history."
I was shocked to find that she had things in her history that were so terrible that CPS felt the need to investigate and eventually remove the children from her care.
"Three months ago, things really changed."
My son had to move in with my husband and I.
My infant granddaughter also moved in.
"Now that she's here, I find myself raising her on my own."
This poor innocent child now has to suffer the consequences of her parents' actions.
Why is it that the good among us always find suffering at the hands of those who choose to do badly?
"Although it has been so difficult, my sole focus is on this beautiful child and making sure she has the love, care, and attention that all innocent children deserve."
Today my first grandchild was born into the world.
My grandchild is a girl and that is happy.
"However, her mother is what brings the sadness."
My son's girlfriend is a possible prostitute.
She is a known drug user.
She is twenty two years old and already has two children from previous relationships.
The youngest of which she does not even know for certain who the father is.
Another sad thing is that she has child protective services involved with the two boys and now this girl.
She got high and her two year old was out wandering the streets alone.
The police were called and found her passed out on the sofa.
"Now, they are involved with this baby."
"My granddaughter, son, and his girlfriend are having to move in with me and my husband."
We have to sign papers that we will watch the child and not allow her mother around her unsupervised.
Basically I now have to raise my grandchild as my own child.
Over the past few months CPS has twice assigned me as a guardian protector of sorts of the child due to her mother.
Her mother has now been diagnosed with a mental disorder and is being watched closely for that and for drug use.
It's hard having them all in the home.
I have been trying to help all of them.
I also spend time trying to help my son to be strong enough to raise the child on his own if he has to.
I hope every day that she has a bright and safe future.
"After trying for a year to have a baby, I finally got pregnant."
"We had the name picked out right away for each gender, we knew how we were going to decorate the room, we notified everyone, we were just ready."
"Then, 6 months ago, I had a miscarriage."
I thought it just meant I wasn't meant to have a baby.
"When everyone found out, we were flooded with support, gifts, small favors, etc."
My husband and I haven't tried again and I don't know if I ever want to.
"Dear Diary,Well, the day has come."
"I didn't think that this would actually happen to me, but it did."
You never think this kind of thing would happen to you until it did.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I don't want to go to school.
I don't want to go to work.
All I want to do is sit at home and do nothing.
Feels like just yesterday when I was told I was pregnant.
"From the time I found out to this miscarriage, it was only what?"
"Three weeks, max?"
It feels like I just blinked and the entire event flew by.
"I can't believe, again, that this would happen to me."
How can I be around other kids?
"Since I found out I pregnant, I've thought about it every second of every day - I doubt that that will change."
I had a miscarriage 8 months ago.
It happened on February 12th 2019.
"I was eight weeks pregnant, so barely there, but enough to know and to feel some symptoms."
I found out really early (5 weeks) because my period is like clockwork.
Well...used to be.
The craziest part of the whole experience was actually passing the fetus.
"The pain was some of the worst in my life, and i've been though some other shit in the past."
I felt and saw it - it was kinda like something big going through me and then it was all over me.
"The size of my hand, literally."
"I was able to pick it up, move it, etc."
It's crazy to think about even now.
I loved that trip with my turtle.
He did meet this one kid who wanted to hold him.
So I let him hold him but then he dropped him.
He dropped my baby turtle on the floor of that filthy airplane.
He got so clean after that.
"I traveled cross country with my turtle, via airplane."
"It was a great move across the entire country, I was basically uprooting my entire life and replanting in a brand new state."
I put him into a shoebox with some airholes and a towel to keep him comfy.
"He wasn't happy about his travel arrangements, though, and kept trying to dig his way out."
"But they had to check his box, and insisted on swabbing it for explosives."
"He charmed the TSA instantly and though they finished swabbing within a minute, they spent five or six cooing over my boy."
"He'd attempt to burrow his way out every once in a while, but I let him peek out whenever I was sitting between flights, and the new sights and smells seemed to satisfy some curiosity."
"Once we got to our new home, he sulked in a corner of his tank for a week."
"But he quickly returned to his good natured, turtley self once he realized there was a whole new world to explore now just outside!"
This is going to be his home for years to come.
"He's hopefully never going to have to travel by plane again, and I think he's more than okay with that."
Oh yeah this story haha.
Okay so I was traveling across the country to create a life with the love of my life in a state I never lived in.
"Can't drive so, hopefully airplane security will be cool with a turtle."
"He's a real charmer, so while TSA was skeptical when I first explained the situation, the moment the box opened and Rockso went to say hi to this new exciting person, they were captivated."
"Got to skip the x ray imagers, but they still had to swab him down for potential explosives."
Or drugs?
But really.
He would shuffle around and try to dig his way into the paper towels I laid down for the trip whenever the box was closed.
"He was tucked under the seat in front of me the entire flight, and all you could hear was occasional little flurries of scrapes as he tried to burrow his way out of the box to freedom."
I've always loved taking picture.
Becoming a professional photographer was a life long dream for me.
"When I got hired onto the newspaper, I was extatic."
But getting my first portrait published into a national magazine was a huge milestone.
To see MY picture.
My name in the credits of Time freaking magazine!
In the last 3-6 months I had some of my photography work published in a magazine for the first time.
I am a professional photographer and recently reached a big milestone as a photographer.
I had my first portrait published in a magazine.
I had been trying for a little while to get a portrait published and when it finally happened I couldn't have been more excited!
"It happened 2  months ago, at the evening time on Wednesday."
I discovered i was having cold which i did not really take too serious.
This cold was not the normal cold the whether could have caused.
On the next day i woke up strong and healthy.
"Before noon, I developed a sudden and a strange severe pain, which i never expected that could happen due to my health condition."
"I endure this pain for many hours, Later that day i decided to go to the ER after worrying it could be very serious."
I sense this could be a stroke and was given the all clear.
I was so surprise been so getting better so quick because something similar to this happen to someone i know that took him many month to get recover from it.
That fateful day in June - June Seventh 2019 was a day like any other ordinary day.
The night was what changed everything.
I developed and woke up to an extreme pain.
"This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain."
"Nothing would help it, not over the counter medications, or rest."
Was it a spider bite?
"Eventually, I realized the inside of my mouth was irritated."
"Thankfully, with full rest, mouth rinse, and a positive outlook, the pain was no more."
"Also of note, I ended up making up my work and being given reduced hours, which helped me make up the amount of money lost."
The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth.
My boyfriend and I have been together for several years now.
I thought he was going to ask me to marry him.
"Instead, about two months ago he told me that he fell out of love with me and that he thought we should separate."
My emotional roller coaster has been mostly down.
I have had thoughts of suicide.
"I know that killing myself over a guy is stupid, but they continue to come."
I don't have any support in my life.
My boyfriend was my entire support system.
My parents have been out of my life for several years.
I cannot turn to the since both of them are druggies on skid row.
"I'm thinking to try to go to a support group, but just cannot figure out where to turn."
"I do not want to die, but I cannot imagine a life without him."
This summer was very hard for me me and my boyfriend broke up.
Ive gotten down to thoght about taking my own life.
My boyfriend cheated on me with me with one of my friends just becuase he saw her on facebook.
I am so upset i can manage i thought he loved me like no one else.
My only hope is that i can find myself again ive been struggling though everyday its a battle just to eveh eat food.
I would like to sing i often write my own songs in hope of freedom.
My class mate tells me dont worry about anything but just helping myself.
These days i just feel like smashing my head threw a wall becuase i am just being consumed by overwheling revaltions about this world and who i ama.
I dont know how people can just move on like that do they not feel as deeply as they show.
I want to be proud of myself and make the ones who came before me proud.
He still does not love me the same i see his face everyday and its still the same.
I am very depressed i feel lile im losing my self worth and i just dont know what to do.
I was a fool for thinking i can find love i muat of been out my mind.
I know one thing i am going to go for my music that is the only thing o have left now and i am slowly losing that.
My mind has been in and out im doubting myself more than ever i am just a loser.
Some days i really just want to kill myself who do i have.
after about 2 minute i had to lift my eyes to look at him to my greatest surprised he crawled away from where i kept him to a little space in front of him.
this means this reduced his reliance on me for carrying him around always.
"Although, There are a number of critical breakthroughs that your infant will reach early in life."
But there’s nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time.
Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby’s improvements.
Most babies begin to crawl somewhere between 6 and 10 months of age.
my baby started crawling at 8 months of age.
"About a month ago, my first son began crawling."
It was an awesome experience to watch him learn how to move on his own.
To be able to put him down and let him do his own thing was a welcome experience after several months of carrying him everywhere.
I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press.
I am willing to do the extra work around the house so that he has a safe and functional environment to play and learn in.
I am lucky enough to work from home so I get to be around him all the time.
Every time his independence increases and his reliance on me decreases I feel like my experience as a parent gets better.
"Since last writing about this event, it has continued to progress and develop."
My son is now much more mobile and active than he was when I last wrote about this.
He is walking around (while holding onto things) and climbing all over everything.
He has grown so much in the last few months.
"It is clear that at this stage, his growth is faster than it has ever been."
I assume that his growth will continue to accelerate until we can't even keep up with him anymore.
"Enough time has passed that I am beginning to miss when he was smaller because of the simplicity we had in our lives, but I love watching him learn and grow up."
I look forward to seeing him start to walk on his own.
I went to my older brothers wedding a few months ago!
I never thought he'd actually get married--he didn't seem the type to be interested.
"I bet his girlfriend convinced him, he's just a really passive guy."
"I don't even think he really cares about this kind of thing, it's all for show."
"He's very wealthy, so everything looks straight out of Gatsby in the venue."
"It's beautiful, and I feel a bit of jealousy."
I was probably more excited than him about organizing all of this--I'm a bit of a control freak.
"The rest is a little bit hazy, I drank a little too much at the start, so the rest was a blur."
"They announced they would be departing for their honeymoon within the next week, and that his wife was actually pregnant."
"I was happy, but a little disappointed in him."
My brother was getting married.
I went to attend his wedding.
The wedding was being held several hours from where I lived.
They had rented out an entire resort with cabins for all the guests.
The weather was very nice the whole time.
"I served as a best man, so I was involved in the wedding ceremony itself."
The event I am thinking about is my brother's wedding.
"I had known her for many years, as we went to high school together."
"The wedding took place a few hours east of where I live, in a beautiful setting with forests and a river."
We went on a fun rafting trip that day.
It was set up outside with seating near a small lake.
"Dear Diary, I am stressed out over Auntie's diagnosis."
Who took me by surprise was the stroke she had during treatment.
I was not ready to handle this level of stress.
Just when things seems to be going right for once in my life.
Here this comes.
i was wrong.
THe hope that she would live was bad enough.
Hard to breathe right now.
Earlier this year my aunt  was diagnosed with cancer for the fourth time.
She had asked me to be the executor of her trust so we spent a lot of time together going over important details and how to handle things after her death.
"We expected her to live a lot longer, but she died suddenly and not from the cancer."
He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life.
One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke.
"She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this."
She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really.
"She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond."
So the decision was made to let her go.
"It was sad that she died this way, and so soon."
"We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke."
"I then had to take over as executor of her trust which wasn't an easy task, and I had to inform people of her death and post on Facebook for her."
"When Auntie was diagnosed with cancer for the fourth time, it was rough, but we thought she'd beat it."
Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her.
"Then, out of the blue, she had a massive stroke which reduced her to still alive, not needing life support, but also not able to really communicate."
"We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc."
"It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away."
Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources.
"Much to my surprise, I was completely unable to do everything she asked, and had to resign as executor and hand it back over to my young cousin and be there for him for support."
"The day that I found out I was pregnant, my husband and I were ecstatic."
"However, when we told our son the news he was not happy about it."
We found out I was pregnant with a girl and we thought it might make it feel more real for our son knowing he would have a little sister.
I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy.
One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital.
There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section.
"Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much."
"After nine long months of waiting to meet my daughter, I got to hold my baby girl in my arms today."
"The spinal block was awful, I thought I was going to be sick."
"It could be because I'm not home too, change is always hard for a toddler."
"I knew he wasn't going to be thrilled, but he actually bit her head."
My daughter was born on December 4th.
It was a planned c-section after a high risk pregnancy.
"The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again."
"With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery."
This time was different.
He was barely two.
I didn't know if he was going to be upset.
My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.
That's when he leaned over to kiss the  baby on her head.
"Until the baby started screaming, that is."
She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.
"He then asked us to 'take her back, please'."
About 3 months ago I was in California working on a project for a new building.
It was going to be the project that sent me into mega bucks.
I am sitting at my desk staring at a blank screen because my ideas had ran out for new buildings weeks ago and I was drawing a blank.
My cell rings and it's my mother.
She tells me my grandfather has passed away and I need to come home.
I clearly couldn't leave in the middle of this project.
It was my job or my grandfathers funeral.
"I wanted to tell that boss where to shove it, but I stayed."
It was the worst decision I have ever made.
"Yes, I kept my job, but at what cost."
My family refuses to talk to me.
My grandfather is dead.
I am here alone with my money.
I want to kill myself.
Today I am going to share something that I never wanted to think again in my life.
"However, after reading the requirement that was the first thing came in my mind."
This happened almost three months ago while I was away from home.
He used to tell me a lot of old stories about him and I used to enjoy them a lot.
"However, after few days I got a call from my mom that the grandfather just had a heart attack and he is in ICU now."
I went straight to the airport and found out the flight just left and the next flight was in about 3-4 hours.
Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day.
I just wanted to go to the hospital and see him.
"I asked my mom what happened, where is grandpa?"
Is he okay?
"She said “he is no more, he left us”."
When I heard this I felt like I lost my best friend.
That was a big loss of my life.
I still miss him a lot in so many cases and still cry remembering his stories.
The worst day of my life is when I lost one of my best friends my grandpa.
The day he passed away I was out of town for some business purpose and that was the first time that I was leaving him for about two weeks or so.
"In addition to that, I called him couple times while I was away but suddenly, he had a heart attack and my family took him to the Emergency."
He fought with his life in ICU for couple hours before he died.
"As soon as I found out about this, I went straight to the airport, but the flights were delayed for couple hours due to incremental weather."
"However, I took the first flight and went straight to the hospital, but it was too late."
I still regret about this and perhaps will never forgive myself and will never forget that incident.
I booked a trip to Rocky Mountain National Park.
It was a quick plane flight there but the drive to the actual park took quite a while.
Majestic was the only way to describe the land in this area.
After spending sometime there I decided to go white water rafting.
I loved riding the rapids there.
"Today, in Boulder Colorado, we made the long drive to the Rocky Mountain National Park."
"In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos."
"Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover."
It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier.
It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains.
"Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting."
"While the air temperature at river level was still in the 90s, the cold water felt refreshing with every rapid."
It was our first trip to Colorado since I was a very young child and the first overall with my new family.
"My wife and daughter had never been to the Rocky Mountains either, so it was sure to be a treat."
We stayed with my wife's cousin and were there primarily to visit my wife's aunt.
She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life.
"Unlike the typical park in a city setting, this was a huge, and I mean huge area, covering a vast majority of the Rocky Mountain range."
"My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also."
"After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting!"
"My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter."
"No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in!"
She was 'rescued' but soured for the rest of the ride.
About one week ago I took m;y oldest child to college.
"It was a very emotional time for me, but no so much for my kid!"
I have reached out to other parents for support.
I think a support system is very important.
i am so very proud of him.
i don't know if i will be able to wait to hear from him.
we moved our son to college.
when we finally got to his college apartment our moods changed a little due to the chaos of everyone moving in.
"This, also, was a fun time."
we decided the best layout for his room and his furniture.
It is very hard for a mom to leave her son behind to be on his own.
I was not aware that i needed to pay taxes on Patreon income.
"It made sense after the fact, since it is income."
I should have known.
But going back over the forms and figured it out.
I four years to go back over.
Overall it wasn't that big of a deal too.
The installments made it easy in a way.
I just felt it was different in some way.
But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer.
I feared getting into serious trouble.
"This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief."
"But as time wore on and the amount of the income increased, I began to worry."
It was becoming the majority of my income.
And eventually I quit my wage job and it became my main source of income.
It turned out that I owed about 6k in back taxes for the previous four years.
And my monthly income was within the personal exemption amount.
So my worst fears weren't realized.
Three months ago I discovered that I'm pregnant.
There was a time in my life when I didn't think I would ever want to have kids.
"I mean, they're just so sticky and smelly and...they just seem like work."
"But the more I think about it, the more I realize that this might be a gift."
"Maybe I'm ready for my life to mean something more than...to be about something more than just me, just getting through, just going from one moment to the next."
I keep thinking about the future.
"I never really thought much about it before, never really thought about the past either for that matter."
"And now, all of a sudden, it's like time has just opened up before me."
Where are they going to end up?
"It makes me dizzy, like looking up at the stars from the top of the mountain--how they just keep going and going."
"It scares me too, makes me afraid for this little life I'm going to bring into the world."
A little over 3 months ago I discovered that I was unexpectedly pregnant.
"I am also a very independent woman, with a good career and almost done with my MBA."
So the timing is a little hectic.
Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant.
"At first it was a huge shock, and honestly I wasn't very happy."
"After some months to get used to it, I can honestly say I'm very excited now though."
"It's been a huge adjustment, however."
I went from living alone to having my boyfriend move in to help with my bills.
I am progressing smoothly.
"It is now my sixth month, and I'm heading into the 3rd trimester."
The first was rough.
"However, the second trimester was way better."
I actually was able to take my son on a little vacation to NYC a couple of weeks ago.
"Although he was hoping for a boy, and we found out we're having a girl."
I have an amazing partner who is such a great help though.
I couldn't be any happier with how my life is currently going.
It's amazing how everything just works out as it's supposed to.
"I never would've dreamt it would be possible to have it all, but here I am living beyond my wildest dreams!"
A family member needed help doing a birthday party.
I recently celebrated the birthday of a family member.
We had put so many candles on the birthday cake that the flames started to merge into one.
"The birthday person had to blow out the candles quickly, otherwise the flames might have reached the cake!"
"We lit the candles, and soon the candles erupted into a large flame."
It was a normal day in Portland Oregon.
I was in the bathroom and some dude was shooting up in the stall.
I told the staff to watch out he may be using in the bathroom.
It turned out to be true and he overdosed.
I actually know the guy kinda which is weird well I have seen him a few times.
They were able to bring him back to life.
They totally allow people to use drugs anywhere and sometimes even help them inject in some cities.
I do not support drug use around the city and in public or really anywhere.
My story is about a family reunion in June of this year.
My grandparents came here when they were nineteen from Europe around 1911.
He remarried a girl much younger that was my babysitter and they had one girl.
"After he married her , she stopped inviting me and my sister over   and my dad would call occasionally and say come over, but when you weren't invited over for the past few years, you don't feel that invite is sincere and I didn't go."
So my cousins wanted to come in for my dad's 90th and they brought all kinds of food and pictures and we had a good time .
I think that will probably be our last family reunion .
But it is also sad that it probably won't happen again .
My  cousins from my dad's side of the family and from  out of town called and said they were coming in .
They said it would be a reunion .
It was a fun day and sad also when my dad gave a little speech at the end and said how proud he was of all of us.
It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long.
It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.
We made plans to see each other again in September and I am looking forward to that .
"The last month has been pretty wild, but I'm finally starting to settle in."
"Moving away from my hometown was a crazy change, and it's hard to believe I actually went through with it."
At least for me anyway.
"It was my snoozefest of a desk job that forced me to pack up and head across the country for a new life, but the dull familiarity of the area was a big reason too."
I probably should give myself more credit for actually pulling such a change off too.
"This new life has the potential to really let me grow in ways that I never could back home, so I'm just pumped about getting to blaze my own trail at this point in my life."
"After having a career-ending stroke 2 years ago, I had to have many operations in 2018."
"Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I."
"Within this time, I became reacquainted with my very first kiss 48 years earlier."
Her name was Debbie.
She said she was very single and living with her son in Daytona Beach Florida and invited me down (I lived in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio at the time.)
"So, I visited this woman I had not seen in 48 years in April of this year."
"I was shocked that she wanted to see me the entire time I was there, but dismayed I didn't get our second kiss."
I found and find her very attractive still.
"My life as I knew it, was over in Ohio."
"Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down."
"It was furnished and the cost was affordable, thus I decided on it, and began to throw away all my furniture and everthing else from my long past."
"When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live."
There was no house.
I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home.
"The move itself now cost me $2000 and I have no furniture, forks, knives, dishes, pots, pans.....well I had nothing to put into it."
"And it took me until the 3rd week of August to move in, and then I find out that a Hurricane is currently headed straight for Daytona Beach right now."
"But, I plan to now make this my home and see what happens."
I was about to move from Ohio to Florida.
"I felt stagnant in Ohio, while at the same time I was interested in a woman I had met nearly 40 years ago when we both shared out first kiss when we were both 13."
"I had a stroke 2 years ago, and was now retired."
At this same time I had been talking to my first kiss when I was quite young.
I was shocked that she had been single for almost 12 years.
"The weather would be perfect, the ocean was near, and the chance for romance spurned me on."
"I had a furnished mobile home awaiting me, the lady I was interested lived very near where I would me, and money would be plentiful for my happiness."
"But, then everything that could've gone wrong did."
Practically noone showed up at any of them.
And then things got worse.........
"When I got down to Florida, I found out that I'd been scammed by the person that said they had a mobile home for me to rent."
THERE WAS NO FURNISHED HOME!
Talk about being floored!
"During all this, the woman I came down to see said she didn't want a romance, and that she just wanted a friendly platonic thing."
(This after  talking to her for over 2 years over the phone.
"Thanks to my sister lending me the money, I have now found a mobile home that I have bought with my sister's money."
"I have no furniture, and very little money to try and furnish it and to get by."
I attended a friends wedding today.
All her friends from the past were part of the ceremony and it was quite uplifting.
I was glad they shortened the ceremony a bit.
But in the end they just focused on things they both liked and what they knew the guests would like also.
So the main focus was on food and games.
Not so much the formal aspects.
It was quite entertaining the different choices they had.
It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles.
Overall one of the best weddings I have every attended.
It was a simple affair in the backyard of a friend's house.
She was marrying her girlfriend of 5 years.
My parents were there as well as my dad's sisters.
Also in attendance were her girlfriend's family and friends.
Everything was cooked by various guests of the wedding.
The best food served was the burnt ends brought by my dad.
It really felt like it came from a professional.
Two women decided to be together for the rest of their lives on this day.
It took place on a breezy and cool May afternoon.
It was a beautiful ceremony attended by friends and family.
I was able to enjoy some of the best burnt ends I had ever had.
It was was made by one of the brides who has great cooking skills.
Their relationship feels like a template and a good example to follow.
They get along very well and are able to communicate.
Overall I'm happy that they found each other.
I hope I'm able to find something like that in my future.
It went really well and you could tell the low income people were really happy here.
A lot of them were just really intrigued by the whole process of growing a garden.
I really have to say it intrigued me too.
"They are low income people, and I even hate that term now, they are just people to me now, and I am just glad we were able to help them."
I think it was just something that needed to happen for me to wake up a little bit.
"Now I really want to do as much as I can to help people, either similar to me or just not in a good spot, like I am for now."
"This also let me know that I might not always be in good spot, and that there are people out there who could and want to help me."
"Besides the important thing of helping people who needed it, the whole garden part about it was really nice as well."
"Now that I know more about that, and how it can bring people together, I am really intrigued by it."
"Its something that is a process, but at the same time it is also peaceful."
This was something that I am just glad I got to experience with people who really ended up making me happy in the end as well.
I look forward to helping more when I can.
In May I signed up to volunteer at a garden giveaway in my town.
The event was way more than I expected.
We had over 100 people show up.
"They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them."
The best part about it was the kids that came.
It was encouraging to see.
It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store.
"I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today."
The whole experience of volunteering at the giveaway left me with a good feeling and I plan to work the event in years to come.
This was a charity event that a charity in my town puts on every spring.
Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids.
At this year's garden giveaway they had a Big Seed contest.
The charity gives the seeds to the local schools who give them to the students.
My favorite part of the giveaway this year was the look on the little boy's face who won for biggest plant!
He was so proud.
It's moments like that that touch me the most.
How easy it is to make a child feel special and proud of themselves.
Three months ago a trail of events happened that was really awful for me and my family.
First my mom fell and was hospitalized.
The she had to go to rehab to be able to function better but instead of getting better she had to go to a nursing home.
Shortly after she died in the nursing home.
I really should know better.
I am really glad they are all able to lean on each other.
She had fallen at home and broke her wrist.
She was hospitalized.
They were unable to improve her strength or balance.
I was concerned about the number of times my mother had fallen recently.
She fell when she was less than a foot away from me.
"It happened so quickly, that I had no chance to help her or slow her fall."
I was actually quite relieved when the hospital suggested rehab.
"She was never strong enough to go home, and she passed quietly in her sleep."
I went to my cousin's wedding last Sunday and had a really good time.
My cousin however wasn't so happy when the caterers brought the food and cake out.
It was a disaster.
"They totally screwed up the menu, it was like they got another wedding order mixed up with my cousins."
There wasn't one thing on the menu that she had ordered.
"The cake was the same way, it wasn't even close to what she wanted and she was obviously upset in the wedding photos."
The band was excellent and everybody said they enjoyed the music.
My cousin got married about three months ago.
"Her husband's father owns a farm up in the country, and that's where they had the wedding."
"It was a beautiful view of the fields at the ceremony, but it was way too hot for an outdoor wedding."
"The reception was inside one of the storage facilities, so that didn't help."
"They were having issues with the food too, as there wasn't enough of it and they had to order pizza."
We got a big picture with all the cousins together.
"Some of my cousins live in England, so it was great to see them and catch up."
I don't get out to the country often.
This was a while ago now.
The wedding took place on a farm that belonged to my cousin's father-in-law.
"Since there were no trees around, it was nice and quiet and quite beautiful."
"It was very hot, and the reception being held in a nearby metal barn didn't help either."
"The bathrooms were in a trailer that was air conditioned, so that was nice."
"I was able to see family from Chicago, England, LA, and other places I don't normally get to see."
"They had an issue with food running out, so my aunt had to call a local pizza place for an emergency order."
"The ceremony was nice, and my cousin looked beautiful in her dress."
"In an odd turn of events, I never actually got to speak to her husband, even though we were in a picture together."
"For the first few weeks I got nothing and no activity, then about a month ago animals came."
I was out misting the peonies and the bird kept flitting in and out of the hose.
I moved the hose and the bird moved too.
As I watered the cacti by the chain link fence I noticed a humming bird.
The thing is he did not want water to drink he wanted to get wet by the mist of the garden hose.
The bird loved it he stayed stationary in the water stream for a long time.
If I moved the hose a little he would follow to stay in the stream.
I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.
I saw a hummingbird at the corner of my eye.
The hummingbird loved this.
He/She darted in and out of the stream of water.
"It was no afraid of me, it liked the water."
"About twelve weeks ago, my husband and I decided to head down to Miami."
I wanted to see my sister and surprise her on her birthday.
"Because the family is kind of spread out around the country, we don't get to see each other as often as we would like."
I don't think I've ever seen my sister so surprised or happy when we all yelled Surprise and turned on the lights when she opened the door.
In April I traveled with my husband to Miami to visit my niece and family.
We celebrated my sister's 74 birthday.
We toured a lighthouse.
We also played with a two year old and found out that another one is on the way.
We had a low country boil in honor of my sister's birthday.
The traffic was bad coming home.
Or maybe we should plan a trip for Dec. when the new baby is born.
"We arrived right at lunchtime, but my sister and husband hadn't gotten there yet."
"Once my sister (C) arrived we started to have lunch, but not before N took her mother's sandwich and hid it."
She made C find it in the oven which was her way of telling her mom and dad that a new grandchild was on the way.
Later we found out that N's husband (J) was working his last day for the major department store he worked for.
They were restructuring and he was being laid off.
But they weren't too concerned about that.
On Sat.
On Monday it was discovered that the septic system was having an issue.
J called someone and we all took off for a little place that sold the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had.
The most unexpected thing happened to me about 3 months ago.
I've been so busy since then that I'm just now writing about it.
I'm such a procrastinator!
"My best friend and I were on our way to see my favorite band, Highly Suspect, perform at the Amphitheater when I heard my phone ringing from the depths of my purse."
"It was an automated call from the local rock station I listen to religiously on my way to and from work, telling me I had won a trip to Las Vegas."
"I had totally forgotten about it because I never win anything, even though I check the page daily for new contests."
I almost thought it wasn't real.
The lady who answered the phone assured me that if I had gotten the automated call I had definitely won the trip.
"She got real quiet and said she needed to check something, so she put me on hold."
"When she came back on the line it was with the most awesome, unexpected news!"
I had actually won a trip to Mexico.
It was the most amazing trip and I will forever remember it!
I had finished work for the day and I was driving to a concert that was approximately 2 hours away.
I was very excited as I was going to see my favorite singer with one of my closest friends I do not see often.
He told me that his mom heard my name on the radio and that I won a trip to Las Vegas.
I had 10 minutes to call in and claim the trip.
"I called in and to my surprise, I won a trip for two to Mexico."
I was extremely excited as I won a trip and was seeing my favorite singer all in the same day.
"That was easy, my girlfriend."
We hadn't been dating that long but I knew she was the perfect choice.
The concert was a blast as was the trip to Mexico.
The event was a concert.
My spouse was home with the kids.
Then it happened.
I got a call.
It was a friend of mine saying that they heard my name on the radio and I had 15 mins to call to claim my prize.
They say i did not win?
"But sure enough, I was the winner."
It was a 4 day 3 night free trip with airfare to Las Vegas.
Both me and my spouse love Vegas.
"We enjoy the people watching, lights, hot weather, and gambling (even though we never win)."
"About 6 months ago, I decided to learn more about the art of food foraging and how it could be beneficial to me."
I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat.
"After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find."
"As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible."
This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure.
I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory.
"Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me."
"At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different."
About 6 months ago I learned how to forage for food.
It has been an eye opening experience.
It is kind of shocking to learn that there is so much plenty all around and yet we live in deprivation.
I learned about it after I watched a video on it.
It really opened my eyes and showed me something new.
There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities.
Things we call 'weeds' are actually nutritious and delicious plants.
I have grown alot since I woke up to all this.
I have stumbled across something new to me lately.
Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it.
"After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it."
Now I can identify many plants in my area.
This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery.
I am very glad to have stumbled upon this field of knowledge.
"A month ago, I went on a hiking adventure in 2019."
I went with several family member.
It was a fun experience.
It was a big adventure.
There was a panic at one point.
My brother slipped in the middle of the hike.
We celebrated with a big picnic.
It was a feast of some chicken and apple pies.
"July 14, 2019On the morning of July 14th myself, my husband, my brother, my niece and my sister and her husband all decided to hike to the top of Mt."
Although it was very hard because it was up hill the whole way I made it to the top.
Two of our party did not make it to the top but tried their best.
I really enjoyed our hiking expeirence although it was very taxing.
I would love to try again in the future and see if we can make it to the top faster the next time.
A couple summers ago my family and I took a trip to the Smoky Mountains.
Leconte via Alum Trail.
Fast foward two years later.
My hiking companions this time are the same minus my daughter.
The path is much more strenuous this time and by the time we make it to Alum cave we are wiped but determined to continue.
As they continue it becomes to strenous for my brother and he has to abandon the hike.
As we round the last bend in the trail and see the top we are overjoyed!
We made it!
We have decided to return in a couple years and see if we can all make it to the top.
It's been three months since my family and I went on a cruise.
We had a wonderful time!
We made so many happy memories!
It wasn't all fun and games though.
There were a few things that almost ruined our vacation.
My aunt had her room broken into and someone stole most of the jewelry that she had put on the counter in the bathroom.
"At first it didn't seem like the 'boat police' were doing anything to help, but it was only a few hours before they caught the man that had broken in."
My aunt got her jewelry back and when we got to the port they put the man off the boat.
My aunt even led the conga line around the deck after dinner.
The cruise ship was really nice to us after that and they even upgraded our rooms for us.
They moved us into a few of their family suites that were unoccupied.
It really was great!
About three months ago I went on a family vacation.
"Our niece also turned 13 on the cruise, and for her birthday my husband and I took her bowling on the boat."
There were a lot of downsides to the cruise.
"Things like the oppressive heat, bad food, etc."
contributed to a somewhat negative experience.
"However, many positive things will help to keep the memory happy."
I went on a Mediterranean cruise with family.
"The cruise was for my in-laws 55th anniversary, so they took the whole family."
The food on the boat was another negative part of the trip.
"We had many food allergies in the group, and they did not do a good job accommodating."
"However, I do not have a desire to go on the particular cruise or cruise line again."
My son looked so handsome in his gown and cap the day of his graduation.
I think back to the look we shared as he was walking down the lane to find his seat.
He was a vision compared to his other classmates.
The road up until here was not an easy one but we made it.
The arena was prepared for a prestigeous ceremony with attendees from prestigeous educational backgrounds.
This is what we had all been waiting for all these years.
I recently went to my son's graduation ceremony.
He was graduating from college and it was a very special trip for me.
"Luckily, I was located above the exit that the graduates were filing out of."
"At the very end of the night, the most wonderful thing happened."
The most memorable part of the evening was when the graduates were walking out and he looked up and made eye contact with me.
"Every time I think of that night and the pride and happiness for him that I have, the look in his eyes at that moment is the first thing that pops into my head."
"When I look back on the night my son graduated from college, I am overcome with pride and love."
I am usually not that great at taking everything in and focus on small details in my life and at events as opposed to the big picture.
"In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night."
"As the graduates were being released by row to leave the room, I saw that I was sitting directly over the exit that they were filing out through."
"With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes."
I will never forget the look he had on his face.
"It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility."
About three weeks ago I witnessed something scary.
Then a kind of rumbling noise started.
"It morphed rapidly into something more akin to a shrieking noise, with an explosive component somewhere in."
"And it got louder and louder, to the point where it seemed to fill the air around us completely."
And it became quickly obvious that it came from the sky.
"Six jets, clearly war planes of some kind, flew over us, almost as fast as arrows."
Why would they fly like that over a peaceful city like ours?
"In that instant, I didn't feel scared for myself or my community, but I felt horrified by the sheer amount of brute force and power displayed."
it feel little bit cool as summer almost over.
"Suddenly, there is big noise from the sky."
Seven fright jets flied though the sky.
I was too late to take my picture.
I wonder if it is preparing an event for Labor day.
I could have a chance to take a picture.
"however, it didn't happen."
"Sometime, you can't expecting a thing happen twice if you don't know what it from."
There was a big noise from the sky suddenly.
There are seven to eight flight jets flied over the sky.
their are flying in V form above the river .
This was a surprising event happen in a normal day.
She wanted to get some plastic eggs and fill them with Easter candy to hand out along with the food.
"I know they’re usually grateful when we drop off food, especially around the holidays, but this little extra something special really drove it home for them; people truly do care about each other."
Even she wept at seeing how it made them feel.
"I couldn’t thank my daughter enough for reminding me of this lesson, something so simple that I truly forgot it."
It took the little bit of compassion from a teenager to remind me why I do these kinds of things.
And they say teenagers only care about themselves… She’s a good egg.
My family and I volunteer for a charity that feeds the homeless.
"A few months ago, our Saturday fell on the day before Easter."
"But soon, my daughter came down the stairs (much lighter this time)."
She wanted to put mini-chocolate bars in plastic eggs and deliver them with the sandwiches.
"The next day, as we made our deliveries, I watched my daughter's face with as much fascination as I watched the faces of our homeless friends as they opened their eggs."
My family and I work with a charity to deliver food to the homeless one weekend a month.
I wanted to do something special for the homeless.
She didn't return downstairs.
"A little while later though, she came downstairs with an idea."
She suggested we fill plastic eggs with chocolates and deliver them with food to the homeless.
I remember that she became teary eyed as she saw the delight on the homeless people's faces as they found the chocolates.
"Two months ago, I went to a family reunion."
I had a blast meeting my family.
We all got together to perform karaoke.
"Most of the people were drunk, so they didn't mind singing."
I almost fell over while singing.
I was too drunk to sing.
I had to sit down for the rest of the day.
I still had a ton of fun at the reunion.
I went home with some great memories of the event.
It was a great time.
"In June, I went to a family reunion."
It was held at the home of my cousin's former husband in New Jersey.
"This involved taking the subway to Port Authority in Manhattan, then a bus to New Jersey, then calling my cousin on arrival to have someone pick us up."
The whole trip should have take a couple of hours.
We left the house in ample time to catch the bus suggested by the app.
"I found out that the host of the party said we should take a different bus, which was a route run by a different bus company."
"Naturally, this ran on a different schedule."
"When we arrived at the terminal, we found we'd have to wait an hour for our bus."
"When we finally got on the bus, we were relieved, and figured we see everyone in about an hour's time."
Were we mistaken!
We hit one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered.
The trip took well over two hours.
"By the time we arrived, some of the guests were already leaving."
The best part of the whole party was that one of my cousins had come all the way from Massachusetts.
She had told me about a year ago that she loves coconut flan.
She was so surprised and pleased that she cried.
I felt the long trip had been worth the effort.
My cousins organized a family reunion this June.
"First, we planned on taking a bus that we did not realize does not run frequently on the weekend."
We missed that bus by a few minutes.
"When we finally got on the bus, we ran into one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered."
It took us hours to get to the party.
"Therefore, I made that to bring to the reunion."
We did not tell her that that's what we were bringing.
"It came out really well, and she loved did, as did her Cuban-born husband."
I felt the whole long boring trip was worth the effort when I saw how happy it made her that I had thought of her and made one of her favorite dishes.
"Two weeks ago, I got a promotion."
"This promotion I had been waiting and hoping for, for the last year."
"It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July."
It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early.
"I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager."
The event that recently happened to me was that I received a promotion at work.
I was actually promoted earlier than I was supposed to be.
"I was supposed to be promoted in September of 2019, but instead, I was promoted starting in July of 2019."
It was a normal day when it first happened.
"I was doing cases, when my supervisor called me into her office."
"Instead, I was greeted by her telling me what a great job I've been doing."
"She told me that she put in for early promotion for me, and it was approved instantly."
"I also love that I was able to get promoted so early, and I also heard that nobody in a long time has been promoted early like I have."
Even people I don't really talk to that much.
I was having a good time that day I ended up going out to eat twice and I went shopping a few times as well.
It was during my last trip to the store that night.
During my time at Target I ended up running into someone I used to know.
we had a nice little conversation at the time we met at target.
after all was said and done we hugged and talked some more and eventually came to the decision that we would talk to each other again.
I was celebrating in different ways with family and friends for the most of the day but the last place I expected to be by the end of the night was a Target.
There's this girl I've known for about 13 years now.
"During those 13 years we would date, break up, date, break up."
"Eventually, the last time it happened, we stopped talking for the longest time period and to me it was like we both finally got the point that it wouldn't work out."
"This night, someone wanted to stop really quickly at Target because they needed something to drink and another person wanted to grab something for their phone."
I break off alone and walk through the store to find something in particular and this familiar voice calls my name.
I'm terrified and happy at the same time when I hear it because I know it's her.
I think of all of the pain and heartbreak associated with her and how much I despised her after we stopped talking three years before.
"Yet, there she was, saying my name in the gentle yet comforting way she always did and smiling at me like I was something to be proud of."
"We walked towards each other, stunned, and embraced one another."
"For what seemed like ages, we just held each other and didn't say anything."
"Finally, after two minutes or so she whispered in my ear, 'I miss you'."
She told me how awful her life had been going and expressed how she wanted to end it all.
"By the end of it all, I unblocked her from my phone and saw older texts flood in."
I ended up calling her again.
It was a fun night overall of catching up and enjoying ourselves.
I stop in an isle and I hear a voice call my name.
"I froze, caught up in a whirlwind of tons of emotions because I recognized that voice."
"She looked different, like the happiness had been sucked out of her."
"Quizzically, she just said my name again."
"Dear Diary, I finally have time to write something down."
I've been dealing with a lot lately.
The other day my wife had a back spasm.
I wasn't home at the time but she had went to the emergency room.
Helping her with her recovery is rather challenging.
It's going to be weeks until shes okay again.
She cant walk.
We had to spend all of our savings.
Luckily because of our daughter at home I'm still able to go to work.
If it wasn't for her I'd have to stay home to help my wife with daily activities.
I'm glad my wife is doing better than the day she had the spasm.
My event of choice happened a few months ago.
My wife had been having back spasm issues from time to time.
"We tried to get state medicaid to cover home care for the problem, but they required her to go to a doctor, which she was not able to do with her condition."
"Finally, the problem got so severe that she had a major back spasm that would not relent."
"As we had no car, I had to call 911 to get an ambulance to take her to the ER."
"There, they verified it was a back spasm related to her herniated disc."
"I had to maintain my stress level, as I have high blood pressure, and call to get her treated."
"It was not easy, but they did finally get her on good meds, a back shot, and therapy...back at the ER that would not allowed to treat us at the start without all of this run around."
The event and following weeks put much financial and emotional strain on us.
"It disrupted our ability to earn money, as we had increased bills."
"However, it is good to know what the problem was."
Only recently have things approximated the old days.
My wife had a back spasm in which she was unable to move and was in severe pain.
This was a long tern event that had been building and had been getting worse and worse.
"However, they would not approved such a doctor, without seeing her PCP first."
"I called 911, and the ambulance took her to the ER, where they gave her meds, which helped the back."
They also gave her enough meds to get her to the PCP to be seen.
"However, the PCP needed to send her for a referral for her MRI test."
"At first, Soonercare denied the MRI."
"Then, they scheduled another place for the back shot."
"After many trips and different places, she was able to get around a little bit."
"It was very frustrating and financially difficult for us, as she provides a lot of family income."
"It is still not fixed, as she cannot get approved for a survery, even though they see the problem."
"Her therapy appointments are used up, too."
"About three months ago after a long ongoing search, I found something of value to me."
This was the home of my dreams!
It was a long and gruelly process but sometimes the things that take the longest to transpire are worth the wait.
One of the most interesting things that happened during the search was the most memorable ever for me.
This was when I met my long time friend from years ago again.
"He and I went to High School together, when we met again he told me about a house that was up for sale after meeting him again in a grocery store."
Not only that but I have rekindled a good friendship that might turn out to be something more.
About three months ago something amazing happened to me.
I bought my first home!
This turned out to be the one.
It was everything I wanted and dreamed of when I first started the process of buying a home.
After years of saving and waiting I was finally ready to buy my first home.
The last house on my viewing list was the one!
It was perfect for me.
There were a few things that needed to be done and a few things that needed updating but the house was exactly what I was looking for.
I worked so hard for this promotion.
But I didn't expect that I would be working even harder after.
It also requires I move to another state.
This was five months ago and wow!
It's been quite a ride!
I have never lived this far away from my family so it's been scary and hard not having them here to support me.
At my age I didn't realize how much I still needed my m'om!
"I think I might get a cat from the shelter to keep me company, i spend so much time at the office that I don't have a ton of time alone."
It's mainly on weekends when I would be out with friends or having dinner with my parents.
I love my new job even though it's so fast paced.
I got a nice raise with the promotion and am able to save money at a pace I never thought I could.
I should be able to move from my apartment into a house within the next two years.
I'm glad I took the promotion even though it required that I move.
And I am flirting with my cute neighbor and think he's going to ask me out..
I have been working hard and about 5 months ago I was invited to interview for a promotion.
It was intimidating to be chosen for this opportunity but I felt ready.
I have been with the company for twelve years but this was still a shock.
I felt the interview went well and I was excited.
When I got the call I still remember being on my bed and I could not smiling.
The other scary part was moving.
I went away to collage but I lived in the same city I grew up in.
There was also a time crunch.
I would need to move out of my current house and get a new one within 2 weeks.
I did not have time to visit the city before I moved and found an apartment online.
What I decided on was close to work but still in a safe neighborhood.
I looked at the process as a challenge but also a reward for my hard work.
"I am currently still in the position and live in the new city, which means I think about it all the time."
Sometimes I think about what it would be like if I stayed but I try not to go that way.
This move is much different than I thought it would be.
It has been hard to adjust to a new environment.
I want to do well but I don't know if I can do it.
More of what I want to do seems out of reach.
I am afraid that it was a mistake.
My life back home was easier.
It was easier to do the same thing again and again.
It was easier to have the same places to go and not be too concerned about what to do next.
I received a raise but not by much.
The was is not what I expected.
He was the best man I have ever met.
"Although he was not particularly fond of anniversaries, he was keen on celebrating our ten year anniversary."
"Three month ago, we had the best time of our lives (I can say it was sweeter than my wedding itself)."
My best friend gave a funny speech and everyone laughed their hearts out.
I couldn't manage a minute before tears of joy started rolling down my cheeks.
I was greatly overwhelmed by how awesome he has been in our first ten years together.
We decided to renew our vows in front of friends and family.
"We all traveled to Charleston, South Carolina."
We had 40 guests from all over the country.
My husband and I have had a beautiful marriage!
"Our love, bond, and loyalty has only grown with every year of new adventures and exciting times."
We were proud of our journey and relationship and wanted to celebrate the enormous milestone of ten years of a healthy and happy marriage.
We decided to renew our vows in front of family and friends.
What a place this turned out to be.
It was everything that I envisioned the natural beauty of this planet could be.
My family went on a trip this summer.
"I think the reason we all enjoyed it so much is because it was something that my parents, myself, and my young children all could enjoy together."
"The vast rock formations, and huge canyon was amazing."
I think the best part of the night was after dinner.
We decided to go to her house to drink some coffee.
"She has a little dog named Bailey, and he doesn't really like new people."
"When my boyfriend sat down on the couch, however, Bailey was immediately taken with him."
He probably enjoyed meeting Bailey more than he did my friend!
I can see the three of us having a very close friendship together!
"I'd known my best friend since we were pre teens, and this was the first time they had met."
We ended up seeing a couple people that my friend and I knew.
"Afterwards, we went back to my friends house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog."
"Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much."
Two months ago my boyfriend and my best friend met for the first time.
"Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house."
"Overall, we had a wonderful time, and I'm sure that my significant other made a good lasting impression on a very important friend of mine."
My brother came to visit me last month.
"We live in the same state, but hours away from each other so we don't get to see each other as often as we'd like."
"Life just gets in the way sometimes, especially as an adult."
We planned a really fun weekend with my other brother.
He arrived early and we started at a brewery near my house.
I was surprised how crowded the place was.
Everytime we get together laughs are guaranteed.
"Last month, my brother came to visit me for his birthday."
"I live in a large city, so I invited him because I thought there would be a lot of fun things to do."
"His train was a little late, but luckily it wasn't too long of a delay."
The next day was my brother's actual birthday.
"We were going to take the train, but when we got to the station we saw the line we needed wasn't running, so we had to walk."
"We had a nice dinner, but when we left it was pouring rain."
"Overall, it was a really fun weekend and I was glad I could spend it with my brother."
My brother came to visit me for his birthday.
We went to Navy pier and walked around.
We also rode the ferris wheel.
He also decided he wanted to go to the planetarium.
On the way back it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella.
Recently I was playing in a local basketball tournament with my team.
We won the first two games easily without much trouble.
Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals.
"Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half."
"The game came down to the final few minutes, where we led by a mere one point."
"In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee."
Right away I knew it was bad.
"Unfortunately we did not have the size on our bench to replace my height, and it cost us the chance for the championship."
"After the game I went to the hospital and they immediately told me I had ruptured a ligament, and would not be able to do much of anything for a while."
"Thankfully I had surgery quickly, but was unable to walk for a few weeks which was quite frustrating."
"My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament."
I think we are more than capable of winning next year if we set our minds to it and can stay healthy!
A couple months ago during summer I was playing basketball in a tournament.
We were doing pretty well in the tournament and had already won several game.
I remember it was like the 3rd or 4th game when something bad happened.
The other team missed a shot and someone on my team got the rebound.
I started running towards my basket and my teammate threw me the ball.
Shortly after I caught the ball I noticed someone on the opposite team running towards me.
The player was a little taller than me so I knew I had to adjust my shot a bit.
"I went up for a lay up with my right hand to fake my opponent, then tried to finish with my left."
During the shot I had to adjust my body in a weird angle in the air so that I wouldn't get my shot blocked.
Because of this I came down really hard on my right knee.
I don't know if it was the angle I landed on or what but I felt a huge strain in my knee as soon as I landed.
I sat at the rest of the game and had to walk with a limp for the rest of the day.
I later on went to the doctor to check it out and found out I ruptured a ligament in my knee.
I had to get surgery to repair it and couldn't walk again for a couple of weeks.
I recently had surgery for my knee injury.
"Surgery went well, but the doctor found the injury was worse than expected."
It also turns out the recovery is way longer than expected.
"However, that wasn't true."
It turns out that this will be a 3-6 months recovery process.
I still can't fully bend my knee back past 90 degrees.
And I still experience a lot of pain.
I am required to wear a knee brace all the time.
All in all right now this wasn't looking like the best idea.
"Not only did we happen to attend the same church, we also share the same birth month."
I didn't know until it was our last year in high school.
We share so much in common.
We had planned to attend the same college and even study the same course.
Her relatives from Germany were also in attendance.
"As she mentioned friends, I was happy she has finally recognized us as part of his college journey."
I didn't expect it when she mentioned how I have been a source of inspiration to her and about how I have been hardwired with the will to go on.
I was moved to tears while she talked about me.
It was an overwhelming and inspirational experience for me and it made me realize who I am and what I am made of.
"In May, my best friend graduated from medical school."
I wanted to attend her graduation but it coincided with my younger brother's high school graduation so I couldn't go.
She did invite me to her graduation party though.
There must have been at least one hundred people there.
I got to catch up with some other classmates from high school who I hadn't seen in a while too.
"Unexpectedly, she talked about me in her speech and my own accomplishments."
She told a room full of people about proud she was of me.
I had no idea beforehand she was going to say this.
I wasn't really sure what to do in the moment.
"In May, one of my close friends from high school graduated from medical school."
I originally wanted to attend the ceremony but I had to go out of town for my brother's graduation.
When I got to the party I saw some classmates that I hadn't seen for many years.
I didn't realize how fancy or big the party was going to be.
Everyone was dressed up and my friend's relatives from Africa were all arriving.
"Clearly, it was a really big deal."
I was really happy I could be there for my friend.
"Finally after a few hours, people began making speeches."
"This included my friend's father, a Cameroonian uncle/preacher, and my friend herself."
"During her speech, she highlighted her relative's recent accomplishments including getting into pharmacy school and their own graduations."
Then she started talking about me!
I thought it was going to be family only but then I heard my name.
"I was not expecting to have the spotlight on me, no matter how briefly, in front of nearly a hundred people."
I was very happy to hear that my friend would include me in her special moment.
"I was out and about on my day off, when by complete chance I got a craving for a candy bar."
"It was then, in the flour aisle, where I ran into her."
"She seemed an ordinary older woman, no different than an average elderly person."
"However, she looked strikingly similar to my mother."
"She was a very interesting woman, and surprisingly, she wasn't taken aback by anything I said."
I told her that I thought she might be related to me.
"I told her my own name, my mother's name, and even some extended family's names."
We decided to grab a donut and a coffee and chat.
It turned out that we actually had quite a bit in common.
I told her i would drop my things off at home and come back to help her carry some things.
She wanted to give me a cake she had made and i declined.
I told her we could go for coffee sometime as a thank you.
She's a lovely woman and now we are friends.

“Julie and the girls at Jet Set Getaways have planned two unforgettable trips to Italy for me and my family.
"Our cooking class in Florence in Meri’s Tuscan kitchen was a highlight topped off with a full day boat tour along the Sorrento Coast, Capri Island, and Nero Bay with Giovanni and having lunch at Conca Del Sogno on our last day."
It’s truly an experience we will never forget.
Outstanding on every level.
Julie and company are true professionals and far exceed any and all expectations.
I cannot recommend high enough.
Do yourself a favor - retain the outstanding services of Jet Set Getaways and I guarantee you will be impressed.
When booking with JSG each of these elements has always been met & often exceeded.
"Additionally, to our surprise, we receive a hand written letter with welcome treats & wine at each hotel!"
It was incredible to walk in our room & feel so special.
I would highly recommend putting your trust in the JSG team to plan your next vacation!
My husband got a huge bonus sent to him in the mail as a check.
We both look at each other and smile.
"We both knew, we'd be off to Vegas for some fun!"
"I eventually would win $1,800."
The casino takes my picture and I was extremely elated with that.
In my situation it was well worth it.
"Me and my husband woke up one day to an email on his phone that had said 'You have been working hard this past week, I will give you a slight raise on your paycheck.'"
It was his boss.
"When we looked at how much money we had, we had a lot of extra money."
We both thought that this was intentional so we decided that the next day we will plan a surprise trip to Las Vegas.
"We were only going to spend two days there, though I wished it could have been longer."
We went into a lot of hotels and gambled for hours.
Later that night we tried to gamble more but I could not find any of our money.
It was only twenty dollars but it was enough for some good breakfast.
We thought all hope was gone when we put that money in that we were expecting to lose.
But just then we saw all the pictures lining up and we won over a thousand dollars.
We were very exited and went to cash it in.
Two months ago I had to take a tech program examination.
My standing at work was under challenge by other people in my company.
If I didn't pass the test I would have been demoted and I would have had my pay lowered.
I didn't want that so I tried my best to pass it.
It was an extremely stressful time.
It was sprung on me at a moment's notice.
I started to calm down when I noticed that the questions were things I was very familiar with.
This gave me confidence that I needed at the time.
I was able to keep my social standing and position in the company.
Your boss or someone else is supposed to help you but I was on my own.
There was no study book or no specific time set aside for me.
I was one course away from finishing the first section of 2 and i could not pass the quiz for the life of me.
You get three attempts before the boss has to ask for the course to be reset.
I had to use that twice.
It ended up taking me all of that Saturday when i was expecting about an hour or so.
It was now off to the final.
I passed it first try and got that monkey off my back.
I had to fight with how awful the computer program was.
You only had three times to pass (and the questions changed) before you had to request a reset.
I used my three attempt and could not figure out how to request a reset.
My store does not really have new employees so my boss had no idea how to reset it either.
I had to call and basically do my own research before figuring it out.
That took a couple days.
I thought I would be there for 2 hours.
I ended up being there for 6 hours.
I passed though.
Now I am fully involved in work and dont feel like my job is threatened.
In the end I would say it was worth it.
4 months ago I had the most amazing experience of my life.
I decided to take a few weeks off from work and just reconnect with myself and nature.
"A friend had suggested I go to Alaska, it was far away and desolate, it sounded perfect."
After much research I wound up agreeing to go dog mushing around the interior of Alaska with a native of the area.
"I had never seen a moose up close, it was breathtaking."
It was a warm winter day in the interior of Alaska with the sun shining brighter than  it has in months.
We ran without a break until we got to the river and i could tell the dogs were getting tired.
We took a break right before the downhill to cross the river and when i looked up i noticed a moose just across the bank.
"The dogs were so tired they didn't even notice, the more i watched this big cow moose eat off the trees i noticed a calf emerge from the woods behind her."
"While i was watching the moose i heard a scream not too far off which sounded like a cat, and indeed it was."
Only 45-50 yards away from the moose was a full grown lynx walking the bank of the river.
Lynx are extremely rare to see in the wild and i was excited.
Just when i thought this free nature show couldn't get any better a second lynx walked out from the woods and began a mating call with the first lynx.
I listened to them and watched them walk the bank for what seemed like and hour.
As I looked out to my amazement I saw a baby moose struggling through the snow.
A minute later I spotted the mom moose not far behind.
"Next, I heard a strange sound I hadn’t heard before."
"As I looked out I saw something trotting through the woods, not far from the moose."
To my surprise it was a lynx.
Lynx are a pretty rare sight as they are very sneaky.
"I noticed another lynx not far behind the first one, it was an amazing sight."
Last month was Amy's birthday and she had decided to throw herself a party since she was turning 30.
It said to meet at the Korean BBQ place in town at 8pm.
"I was anxious because I never had Korean BBQ, but I decided to go anyway."
I am so glad I did!
They cook it on the table right in front of you.
The sauces were the best part.
There was a red bean sauce that I fell in love with.
The desserts were even better.
They had real vanilla bean ice cream and some amazing cakes.
If it wasn't so expensive I would probably eat there every night.
Amy had a great time.
After the dinner everyone was going home but I was still pretty awake and wasn't looking forward to sitting at home.
He asked if I wanted to join him.
We drove to his house and relaxed on the couch and watched Zootopia until It was time for me to go home.
It was a great night.
Dear Diary.
We had dinner at a korean bbq restaurant.
They picked me up at around 5 PM but had to make a stop at Target first because some of my friends had not bought a birthday gift yet.
We were one of the first people to get to the restaurant so we got to pick which table we wanted to sit at and thankfully we all got to sit together.
"It was interesting because my friend had invited 25 people, so many people who were invited I did not even talk to."
Most of us did not even talk to the birthday girl because she was sitting at a different table from most of us.
"The food was expensive and so was the commute (1 hour), but I still think it was worth it."
"Afterwards my friend I was sitting next to at the restaurant asked if I wanted to go see a movie at her apartment, so I did and we watched Zootopia."
"It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out."
The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house.
I was also surprised by how many people showed up.
I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while.
"This dinner was significant to me because my friend was turning 21, an age that is pretty important to a lot of teens."
"It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too."
I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting.
Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her.
But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them.
"This event was significant to me as well because I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I got to see the new place she moved out to."
"It was the first time she was finally living on her own, and it was nice to see her slowly going into adulthood more."
I had a really good experience writing this because it made me feel all these happy feelings I felt when I was going to the party and to my friend's house.
"Dear Diary, Today was a great day!"
The best one would be selected to be implemented by the boss.
I wanted this very badly.
I was so excited when I found out that mine had won!
i am work in an manufacturing company.
i were select as an chief designer for new product used in automotive parts.
i made high potential and efficiency obtained that was quiet surprising.
i were promoted after the success of my project.

"Today I am terrified of public speaking, even the thought of it made me tried."
"My problem was I had social anxiety so over course of 1 o 2 years I am gradually overcame my problem, without the help of any therapist."
I believed in myself.
"this is where the core of my problem lies, A fear of public speaking is often  related with social anxiety and being afraid what others think, dislike being the center of attention being judged etc."
I used to be petrified of speaking in public.
I started raising my hand o speak as often as possible.
I developed a workshop.
A lack of structure often causes a speaker to get  nervous and perform poorly.
you hardly ever forget what you want to say and You give he audience a great way to stay engaged the entire time.
I received the best news that I could have hoped for.
I am all good and cancer free!
This has been a rollercoaster of a year.
I have two young children and a wonderful life.
When the results returned the doctor saw I had a high PSA count.
It was 12.
391 and for a man my age it should have been less than 4.
"After a biopsy, the doctor informed me that I have prostate cancer."
Then the doctor informed me that for my age surgery would be the best way to treat my cancer.
I decided to go ahead with the surgery and have my prostate removed.
Hopefully everything will fine.
This was an unexpected life event for me!
"Like i said in my statement before, i found out i had prostate cancer in March 2019."
Had my prostate removed in August.
Everything went well during the surgery.
However all and all feeling pretty good.
After a leak test not sure what that is called.
"Two months ago, my daughter invited me over for Father's Day."
I was pretty excited because it was also my grandson's 5th birthday that day.
"My son in law barbecued chicken, burgers, and hot dogs for everyone."
I had an amazing time watching my grandson open his gifts.
It never fails to amaze me the delight in a young child's eyes.
"When evening hit, I knew it was time for me to get home before it got too dark out."
I had a fathers day and birthday party bbq in our yard on Fathers day in June.
Bought a unusually large cake for his birthday.
I got him some bugs  for a gift .
they were real bugs encased in acrylic.
He really loved them and could not stop playing with them as well as his little brother.
I got gifts as well for fathers day.
A great light outdoor shirt.
We have made this event a tradition in our family.
Well we have a annual family get together now for the last 5 years.
My grandson has his birthday shortly after Fathers Day so we combine the two.
"I have a younger grandson his brother, and we have a yard bbq party for him also now in August."
We all wathed the balloon for a long time and got it on video.
He watched it after about 10 minutes it disappeared.
We all so much look forward to our yearly bbq now.
I have wore out my bbqer and need to get a new one for next year.
I go out of my way to get the yard looking good.
