It was our first ever family reunion and it was really cool.
"I feel that the most appropriate thing for you to do would be to call the bride and explain your situation, and offer to have them over or take them out when your situation improves."
"I had been sick,throwing up for the past few days and very tired."
After much thought I went ahead and purchased a pregnancy test and took it.
Anxiously waiting for the results  my whole world was rocked.
My mother was gone.
"Due to stage 4 cancer, I'd lost her just 6 months prior."
So after i found out that i would ne welcoming another little one into my life i wasn't sure how to feel.
Many neighbors came together to paint a mural in the middle of the intersection.
"As I ate my donut, I noticed a couple chickens crossing the road."
I had to re-paint the lines that outlined the manatee since they were a little off.
I'm still so angry at mom for not admitting she's wrong!
I finally got the courage to tell her how her hitting me when I was younger really affected me and she still feels like she's justified in it.
My cousin told me my mom is coming to town next week.
My mom is coming to town everybody keeps telling me .
I remember I asked her one year about my childhood and she said God has already forgiven me for the things that have happened to you.
Three months ago I lost a job that paid minimum wage.
That's how I found myself homeless.
I recently came to the realization that most of what I believed in life was a lie.
"So, in need of some relief, I traveled to south Florida to see an old friend."
Megan and I went to college together and lived in the same apartment complex for three years.
Then one night we were out with another friend at a bar together and joked about how we should just give up looking for a partner and date each other.
It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads.
Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together.
"When she showed up, we immediately started flirting."
She ended up staying the night.
We became romantically involved even though both of us sort of knew better.
But I ended up sponsoring her.
But being that close to someone and watching her grow and learn to be happy and care for herself made me sort of fall in love with her.
I told her about my feelings and we started dating.
My older brother is getting married to a rich tycoon woman.
I threw up on my older brother.
It was the first time in almost 10 years all my extended family was planning to get together.
One of the shocking events was watching my cousin (female) smoking a cigar with the men.
Then to top it off her mom who was 70+ comes out and takes the cigar from her and takes a few puffs on it.
It was the first time I actually danced at a formal event with my daughter.
"The pride I feel inside from accomplishing my goal, but the feeling of completeness there is from my Daughter receiving her Masters the same day is indescribable."
"Before they passed away I made a promise, to me I took an oath in their presence, that I would no matter what complete my Masters degree."
Today was the day that I would receive my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering.
"What made this even more special is that I would receive my Degree alongside of my Daughter who on the exact day, was receiving her Masters degree in Chemical Engineering."
"During my senior year and just before entering the Master's program, my girlfriend was pregnant."
I continually put it off until one day that I promised my parents that I would go back to school.
The day came when my daughter received her Bachelor's degree in Biology and we made a pact to get our Master's degree together and that we were going to do it for her Grandpa and Grandma.
"On the day of graduation, before the commencement, I sat in the car with my Wife and silently cried."
"Maybe that's dramatic, but I felt like I was ruining things when I spilled my champagne down the front of my bridesmaid's gown when she was counting on me to just show up and be presentable."
Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out.
The most memorable moment was when I spilled champagne on my dress before the wedding.
"Thankfully, one of the girl's mom was a dry cleaner and immediately took the dress to get the stain out."
"Dear diary, about 6 months ago my cousin got married."
"There was a lot of people in a tight space, so, I bumped into someone and spilled champagne entirely down my blush gown!"
3 week ago my dog passed away and I was not there to see her go.
I had to pull over on the side of the road I was crying so hard.
"Three weeks ago, my dog died."
"When I got there, I was denied the ability to board."
"Over the summer, I was in another state visiting family."
"The next day, my mom informed me that my dog was not doing well."
"While trying to board, I was denied access because my identification had expired since I left town."
"However, I woke up to a text from my mom saying that my dog had not made it through the night."
But two months ago I was at my wit's end.
Once he pulled into a random driveway a young girl wearing a leather jacket came out and got in his car.
They passionately kissed and accelerated off into the night.
"A couple months ago, I was involved in an incident where I found out that my boyfriend was cheating on me."
"I was out to dinner with him at a relatively nice restaurant, and I noticed that he would not stop checking his phone."
"I kissed him and said by like usual, but as soon as he pulled out of my driveway and left, I got in my car and proceeded to follow him."
"I got out of my car, knocked on the door, and when a woman answered the door, I immediately turned around got back in my car and went home."
"Since this event has happened, I have since reconciled with my boyfriend."
"Eventually, I gave in, and we are now back together."
"Unfortunately, we took budget cuts."
"I was the last hired, so I was the first fired."
"I had to buy most of the supplies, and some of the kids are so poor, I ended up having to buy supplies for the kids to even be able to learn."
"Unfortunately, I was the runner up for that position."
It was surprising to me how bad the job market has been considering the news is constantly saying that there is a teacher shortage.
I saw him talking to my daughter later that night at our house and I expected it to get heated but to my surprise they were laughing and smiling.
They ended up disappearing off together for about an hour.
My heart is utterly broken.
"Two months ago in May, my sister-in-law passed away."
She was driving home from work in the rain when she lost control of her car and get into an accident on the interstate.
"Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert."
She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.
She passed away that night.
She was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in her 40's.
She had surgery on her neck a few months before she passed away.
She was scheduled to have knee replacement surgery before she passed away.
She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.
I decided to pick it up today  because I wasn't that busy.
It was my step-father.
A memorable event that happened to me within the past few months was being contacted by my step-father.
Recently he called me out of the blue.
An unfortunate thing I found out while talking to him was that his younger sister passed away from cancer.
The memorable event that I shared was when my step-father got in touch with me after a long time of us not speaking to each other.
This was until he and my mom unfortunately got divorced.
So my step-dad apparently got my phone number from my mom and gave me an unexpected call one day several months ago.
He told me he has a new wife who he said is great and he's very happy being with.
The memorable and rather shocking part of the story was when that my step-dad told me his younger sister had died (only in her 50s) far too soon from cancer.
My dad passed away last month.
"As I was cleaning up the house afterwards, a lawyer showed up."
Yesterday a huge check showed up from dad. Huge.
Five months ago I was still mourning and healing from the abrupt death of my mother who died late last year.
Five months ago he died from that broken heart.
Exactly 3 weeks after his death I started receiving settlement checks in the mail from a lawsuit he had just finished.
After the untimely death of father I continued to close accounts and handle issues that arose in the estate.
I was ecstatic and very surprised when I received the 12 checks in the mail from the lawyer.
I came across the legal paperwork for a case in which my father was awarded money.
"Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long."
The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.
I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.
I noticed that i couldn't control my bladder and the frequency of going to the bathroom was increasing.
I was scared for my life.
"If i didn't go the bathroom once my body called for, my urinary tract would start hurting."
It took weeks to see a urinary specialist.
"Finally, after all that, I popped the question."
I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.
And she said yes!
We were married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.
About two years ago I decided to marry my girlfriend after dating for quite a long time.
She said yes!
I met my now wife a long time ago about 7 years to be exact and it has been great ever since.
The evening was her birthday and I got home just as the delivery man was leaving with the ring.
She said yes!
"When my grandparents sat me down and described how she had hit rock bottom just a week ago, I was shocked."
Today I found out that my wife is going forward with a divorce.
It starts with a husband who made it terrible mistake by having an affair.
"Our next and last trip was in Chattanooga Tennessee, where we stumbled upon two other theme parks."
"We were supposed to visit 6 parks, but one day got rained out and we had to skip it."
"After this, we were supposed to go to Dollywood, but the rain canceled it."
"We both love theme parks, and so our honeymoon was to visit six new theme parks."
"Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm."
"Three weeks ago, my life changed for the better."
She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.
The kids were killed in that horrible accident.
"I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night."
I reminded myself it was time to actually live my life and that meant having more of these happy moments so I decided to get off of auto pilot and truly live.
I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it.
I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit.
"Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom."
"He was killed multiple times in the early game and of course, I was blamed for it."
I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game.
Two days ago my son was harassed at football practice by some of his teammates.
Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.
The entire team -except those kids of course - voted to have the brats kicked off the team for bullying and harassment.
"My son, we will call him Sam, decided to play football."
"The coaches son said some incredibly hateful things to Sam behind his back, but loudly enough  so that Sam could hear."
"When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk."
"A couple of weeks ago, there was a rumor that my co-worker, John had passed away."
The rumor was confirmed to us by his wife and family and everyone at worked was sad to hear the news.
"In fact, we heard that we would be encourage to wear jerseys of his favorite sports team."
Not everyone joined in on the informal attire.
Afterwards we were all invited to a reception at a local sports bar.
Our management decided to have one day a month where we could wear our sports jerseys.
A co-worker friend recently was diagnosed with cancer.
He had been undergoing chemo and was nearing time to go home.
He suddenly caught an infection and got seriously worse and eventually passed away.
Though the service was for his passing it was also used as a celebration of his life and those in who came where encouraged to where casual clothes to not be so formal.
We recently attended the funeral of one of my co-workers.
"His favorite sports team was the Tampa Bay Buc's and it was suggested, not required, that those who wanted to could wear their jerseys to the memorial service."
"Probably close to two hundred friends, family and co-workers showed up at various times to show support to his wife and celebrate his shorter than expected life."
When he had finished we went forward and gave his wife a hug and expressed our shock and surprise at his death.
"As soon as my girlfriend, or should I say ex-girlfriend by now, entered the kitchen, something felt off."
She looked so serious when she's normally so bubbly.
First she said she needed to talk to me.
She said that had found someone else and was no longer in love with me.
My heart sank.
My live-in girlfriend left me after 3 years just recently.
"She said it just didn't fell right, after 3 years!"
"We bought a house together (luckily I put that in my name only), adopted a dog together and I was starting to plan out our future."
"Then that rug was pulled out from underneath me, like Thanos snapping his damn finger."
"I found out she was talking to an ex of hers, but sometimes people make mistakes."
What do you do when she just doesn't want to be with you anymore?
"There was no fight, there was no argument, she just looks you in the face, tells you she loves you and that you are an 'amazing man', but she just doesn't feel right and wants to leave."
"But there it was, she had been looking at places to move behind my back for months and I guess seeing someone else as well."
"I bought my first house with this woman, adoped a dog with this woman and swore to take care of this woman (to her father) and now she wants to leave."
And now she's leaving.
My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series.
She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse.
I know it may sound silly but it was quite emotional to finish what I now consider to be my favorite book.
I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove.
I really miss this book -- it seemed like an old friend.
"Nine months ago, I had a little panic."
My graduation ceremony was set back.
The cause was my dry cleaner was late on delivering my cloth of the day.
it was during my graduation ceremony.
"I had planned to wear a particular outfits for this event just to standout.But unfortunately ,my dry-cleaner almost ruined it and that would have got me upset really."
One of us started misbehaving and convulsing.
People have always made fun of my eyes and how they look crooked.
The eye doctor I visited told me that I could have surgery to have my eyes realigned.
My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain.
The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were.
He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned.
The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery.
"Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life!"
I was experiencing lots of eye strain and headaches and decided to go to the optometrist to get my eyes checked out.
"As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly."
"Four months ago, I had to say goodbye to three friends in my life."
"To loose all three like that, I felt that the world was against me."
In late May I lost my dog.
I still wasn't ready though.
She had been going downhill steadily but it didn't feel like enough time to prepare.
I think a part of me knew that it was coming the day before.
The morning it happened I woke up and she had thrown up on the bed.
"I knew that my dog was doing worse that morning, but she had come around before."
She was laying on her dog bed and breathing heavily.
She let out a few rattling breathes and then she was gone.
"That happiness was short-lived, however, when CPS became involved in the baby's life because of events that had happened in her mother's history."
"Three months ago, things really changed."
My son had to move in with my husband and I.
My infant granddaughter also moved in.
Today my first grandchild was born into the world.
My son's girlfriend is a possible prostitute.
Another sad thing is that she has child protective services involved with the two boys and now this girl.
The police were called and found her passed out on the sofa.
"My granddaughter, son, and his girlfriend are having to move in with me and my husband."
We have to sign papers that we will watch the child and not allow her mother around her unsupervised.
Over the past few months CPS has twice assigned me as a guardian protector of sorts of the child due to her mother.
Her mother has now been diagnosed with a mental disorder and is being watched closely for that and for drug use.
"After trying for a year to have a baby, I finally got pregnant."
"Then, 6 months ago, I had a miscarriage."
Feels like just yesterday when I was told I was pregnant.
"From the time I found out to this miscarriage, it was only what?"
I had a miscarriage 8 months ago.
The craziest part of the whole experience was actually passing the fetus.
"The pain was some of the worst in my life, and i've been though some other shit in the past."
I loved that trip with my turtle.
So I let him hold him but then he dropped him.
"I traveled cross country with my turtle, via airplane."
"It was a great move across the entire country, I was basically uprooting my entire life and replanting in a brand new state."
"He charmed the TSA instantly and though they finished swabbing within a minute, they spent five or six cooing over my boy."
"Once we got to our new home, he sulked in a corner of his tank for a week."
Okay so I was traveling across the country to create a life with the love of my life in a state I never lived in.
"Got to skip the x ray imagers, but they still had to swab him down for potential explosives."
"When I got hired onto the newspaper, I was extatic."
But getting my first portrait published into a national magazine was a huge milestone.
In the last 3-6 months I had some of my photography work published in a magazine for the first time.
I am a professional photographer and recently reached a big milestone as a photographer.
I had my first portrait published in a magazine.
On the next day i woke up strong and healthy.
"Before noon, I developed a sudden and a strange severe pain, which i never expected that could happen due to my health condition."
"I endure this pain for many hours, Later that day i decided to go to the ER after worrying it could be very serious."
I sense this could be a stroke and was given the all clear.
The night was what changed everything.
I developed and woke up to an extreme pain.
"Thankfully, with full rest, mouth rinse, and a positive outlook, the pain was no more."
"Also of note, I ended up making up my work and being given reduced hours, which helped me make up the amount of money lost."
The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth.
"Instead, about two months ago he told me that he fell out of love with me and that he thought we should separate."
I have had thoughts of suicide.
My parents have been out of my life for several years.
"I'm thinking to try to go to a support group, but just cannot figure out where to turn."
This summer was very hard for me me and my boyfriend broke up.
Ive gotten down to thoght about taking my own life.
My boyfriend cheated on me with me with one of my friends just becuase he saw her on facebook.
I would like to sing i often write my own songs in hope of freedom.
after about 2 minute i had to lift my eyes to look at him to my greatest surprised he crawled away from where i kept him to a little space in front of him.
my baby started crawling at 8 months of age.
I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press.
My son is now much more mobile and active than he was when I last wrote about this.
He is walking around (while holding onto things) and climbing all over everything.
"Enough time has passed that I am beginning to miss when he was smaller because of the simplicity we had in our lives, but I love watching him learn and grow up."
I never thought he'd actually get married--he didn't seem the type to be interested.
"I bet his girlfriend convinced him, he's just a really passive guy."
"He's very wealthy, so everything looks straight out of Gatsby in the venue."
"It's beautiful, and I feel a bit of jealousy."
I was probably more excited than him about organizing all of this--I'm a bit of a control freak.
"They announced they would be departing for their honeymoon within the next week, and that his wife was actually pregnant."
My brother was getting married.
The event I am thinking about is my brother's wedding.
"I had known her for many years, as we went to high school together."
"The wedding took place a few hours east of where I live, in a beautiful setting with forests and a river."
We went on a fun rafting trip that day.
"Dear Diary, I am stressed out over Auntie's diagnosis."
Who took me by surprise was the stroke she had during treatment.
Earlier this year my aunt  was diagnosed with cancer for the fourth time.
One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke.
"She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this."
"When Auntie was diagnosed with cancer for the fourth time, it was rough, but we thought she'd beat it."
"Then, out of the blue, she had a massive stroke which reduced her to still alive, not needing life support, but also not able to really communicate."
Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources.
"The day that I found out I was pregnant, my husband and I were ecstatic."
"However, when we told our son the news he was not happy about it."
There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section.
"The spinal block was awful, I thought I was going to be sick."
"I knew he wasn't going to be thrilled, but he actually bit her head."
She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.
My cell rings and it's my mother.
She tells me my grandfather has passed away and I need to come home.
I want to kill myself.
Today I am going to share something that I never wanted to think again in my life.
"However, after few days I got a call from my mom that the grandfather just had a heart attack and he is in ICU now."
I went straight to the airport and found out the flight just left and the next flight was in about 3-4 hours.
"She said “he is no more, he left us”."
The worst day of my life is when I lost one of my best friends my grandpa.
The day he passed away I was out of town for some business purpose and that was the first time that I was leaving him for about two weeks or so.
"In addition to that, I called him couple times while I was away but suddenly, he had a heart attack and my family took him to the Emergency."
He fought with his life in ICU for couple hours before he died.
"As soon as I found out about this, I went straight to the airport, but the flights were delayed for couple hours due to incremental weather."
It was a quick plane flight there but the drive to the actual park took quite a while.
After spending sometime there I decided to go white water rafting.
"In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos."
"Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover."
"Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting."
It was our first trip to Colorado since I was a very young child and the first overall with my new family.
"My wife and daughter had never been to the Rocky Mountains either, so it was sure to be a treat."
She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life.
"After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting!"
"No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in!"
I was not aware that i needed to pay taxes on Patreon income.
But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer.
And eventually I quit my wage job and it became my main source of income.
Three months ago I discovered that I'm pregnant.
"But the more I think about it, the more I realize that this might be a gift."
I keep thinking about the future.
A little over 3 months ago I discovered that I was unexpectedly pregnant.
Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant.
"After some months to get used to it, I can honestly say I'm very excited now though."
The first was rough.
I actually was able to take my son on a little vacation to NYC a couple of weeks ago.
I have an amazing partner who is such a great help though.
"We lit the candles, and soon the candles erupted into a large flame."
I was in the bathroom and some dude was shooting up in the stall.
It turned out to be true and he overdosed.
They were able to bring him back to life.
He remarried a girl much younger that was my babysitter and they had one girl.
"After he married her , she stopped inviting me and my sister over   and my dad would call occasionally and say come over, but when you weren't invited over for the past few years, you don't feel that invite is sincere and I didn't go."
My  cousins from my dad's side of the family and from  out of town called and said they were coming in .
They said it would be a reunion .
"After having a career-ending stroke 2 years ago, I had to have many operations in 2018."
"Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I."
"Within this time, I became reacquainted with my very first kiss 48 years earlier."
"I was shocked that she wanted to see me the entire time I was there, but dismayed I didn't get our second kiss."
"Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down."
"When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live."
There was no house.
I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home.
"And it took me until the 3rd week of August to move in, and then I find out that a Hurricane is currently headed straight for Daytona Beach right now."
I was about to move from Ohio to Florida.
"I felt stagnant in Ohio, while at the same time I was interested in a woman I had met nearly 40 years ago when we both shared out first kiss when we were both 13."
"I had a stroke 2 years ago, and was now retired."
I was shocked that she had been single for almost 12 years.
Practically noone showed up at any of them.
"When I got down to Florida, I found out that I'd been scammed by the person that said they had a mobile home for me to rent."
THERE WAS NO FURNISHED HOME!
"During all this, the woman I came down to see said she didn't want a romance, and that she just wanted a friendly platonic thing."
"Thanks to my sister lending me the money, I have now found a mobile home that I have bought with my sister's money."
Two women decided to be together for the rest of their lives on this day.
It went really well and you could tell the low income people were really happy here.
"Now I really want to do as much as I can to help people, either similar to me or just not in a good spot, like I am for now."
In May I signed up to volunteer at a garden giveaway in my town.
At this year's garden giveaway they had a Big Seed contest.
The charity gives the seeds to the local schools who give them to the students.
Three months ago a trail of events happened that was really awful for me and my family.
First my mom fell and was hospitalized.
Shortly after she died in the nursing home.
She had fallen at home and broke her wrist.
She was hospitalized.
I was concerned about the number of times my mother had fallen recently.
I went to my cousin's wedding last Sunday and had a really good time.
It was a disaster.
"They totally screwed up the menu, it was like they got another wedding order mixed up with my cousins."
My cousin got married about three months ago.
"It was a beautiful view of the fields at the ceremony, but it was way too hot for an outdoor wedding."
"The reception was inside one of the storage facilities, so that didn't help."
"They were having issues with the food too, as there wasn't enough of it and they had to order pizza."
The wedding took place on a farm that belonged to my cousin's father-in-law.
"It was very hot, and the reception being held in a nearby metal barn didn't help either."
"For the first few weeks I got nothing and no activity, then about a month ago animals came."
As I watered the cacti by the chain link fence I noticed a humming bird.
I saw a hummingbird at the corner of my eye.
We also played with a two year old and found out that another one is on the way.
"Once my sister (C) arrived we started to have lunch, but not before N took her mother's sandwich and hid it."
She made C find it in the oven which was her way of telling her mom and dad that a new grandchild was on the way.
On Monday it was discovered that the septic system was having an issue.
The most unexpected thing happened to me about 3 months ago.
"It was an automated call from the local rock station I listen to religiously on my way to and from work, telling me I had won a trip to Las Vegas."
"When she came back on the line it was with the most awesome, unexpected news!"
I had actually won a trip to Mexico.
He told me that his mom heard my name on the radio and that I won a trip to Las Vegas.
"I called in and to my surprise, I won a trip for two to Mexico."
Then it happened.
It was a friend of mine saying that they heard my name on the radio and I had 15 mins to call to claim my prize.
It was a 4 day 3 night free trip with airfare to Las Vegas.
"As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible."
I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory.
"Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me."
About 6 months ago I learned how to forage for food.
I learned about it after I watched a video on it.
I have stumbled across something new to me lately.
We celebrated with a big picnic.
"July 14, 2019On the morning of July 14th myself, my husband, my brother, my niece and my sister and her husband all decided to hike to the top of Mt."
A couple summers ago my family and I took a trip to the Smoky Mountains.
As we round the last bend in the trail and see the top we are overjoyed!
It's been three months since my family and I went on a cruise.
There were a few things that almost ruined our vacation.
My aunt had her room broken into and someone stole most of the jewelry that she had put on the counter in the bathroom.
"At first it didn't seem like the 'boat police' were doing anything to help, but it was only a few hours before they caught the man that had broken in."
My aunt even led the conga line around the deck after dinner.
They moved us into a few of their family suites that were unoccupied.
About three months ago I went on a family vacation.
"Our niece also turned 13 on the cruise, and for her birthday my husband and I took her bowling on the boat."
"Things like the oppressive heat, bad food, etc."
I went on a Mediterranean cruise with family.
The food on the boat was another negative part of the trip.
I think back to the look we shared as he was walking down the lane to find his seat.
About three weeks ago I witnessed something scary.
Then a kind of rumbling noise started.
"It morphed rapidly into something more akin to a shrieking noise, with an explosive component somewhere in."
"And it got louder and louder, to the point where it seemed to fill the air around us completely."
"Six jets, clearly war planes of some kind, flew over us, almost as fast as arrows."
"Suddenly, there is big noise from the sky."
There was a big noise from the sky suddenly.
There are seven to eight flight jets flied over the sky.
She wanted to get some plastic eggs and fill them with Easter candy to hand out along with the food.
Even she wept at seeing how it made them feel.
"But soon, my daughter came down the stairs (much lighter this time)."
"A little while later though, she came downstairs with an idea."
I remember that she became teary eyed as she saw the delight on the homeless people's faces as they found the chocolates.
"I found out that the host of the party said we should take a different bus, which was a route run by a different bus company."
Were we mistaken!
We hit one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered.
"By the time we arrived, some of the guests were already leaving."
She was so surprised and pleased that she cried.
My cousins organized a family reunion this June.
We missed that bus by a few minutes.
"When we finally got on the bus, we ran into one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered."
It took us hours to get to the party.
"Two weeks ago, I got a promotion."
I was actually promoted earlier than I was supposed to be.
"She told me that she put in for early promotion for me, and it was approved instantly."
During my time at Target I ended up running into someone I used to know.
I was celebrating in different ways with family and friends for the most of the day but the last place I expected to be by the end of the night was a Target.
"This night, someone wanted to stop really quickly at Target because they needed something to drink and another person wanted to grab something for their phone."
I think of all of the pain and heartbreak associated with her and how much I despised her after we stopped talking three years before.
She told me how awful her life had been going and expressed how she wanted to end it all.
"By the end of it all, I unblocked her from my phone and saw older texts flood in."
I stop in an isle and I hear a voice call my name.
"I froze, caught up in a whirlwind of tons of emotions because I recognized that voice."
"Dear Diary, I finally have time to write something down."
The other day my wife had a back spasm.
I wasn't home at the time but she had went to the emergency room.
We had to spend all of our savings.
My event of choice happened a few months ago.
My wife had been having back spasm issues from time to time.
"We tried to get state medicaid to cover home care for the problem, but they required her to go to a doctor, which she was not able to do with her condition."
"As we had no car, I had to call 911 to get an ambulance to take her to the ER."
"It was not easy, but they did finally get her on good meds, a back shot, and therapy...back at the ER that would not allowed to treat us at the start without all of this run around."
My wife had a back spasm in which she was unable to move and was in severe pain.
"However, they would not approved such a doctor, without seeing her PCP first."
"At first, Soonercare denied the MRI."
"About three months ago after a long ongoing search, I found something of value to me."
One of the most interesting things that happened during the search was the most memorable ever for me.
About three months ago something amazing happened to me.
But I didn't expect that I would be working even harder after.
It also requires I move to another state.
I got a nice raise with the promotion and am able to save money at a pace I never thought I could.
I have been working hard and about 5 months ago I was invited to interview for a promotion.
When I got the call I still remember being on my bed and I could not smiling.
The other scary part was moving.
I would need to move out of my current house and get a new one within 2 weeks.
I received a raise but not by much.
"Although he was not particularly fond of anniversaries, he was keen on celebrating our ten year anniversary."
"Three month ago, we had the best time of our lives (I can say it was sweeter than my wedding itself)."
My best friend gave a funny speech and everyone laughed their hearts out.
We decided to renew our vows in front of friends and family.
We decided to go to her house to drink some coffee.
"When my boyfriend sat down on the couch, however, Bailey was immediately taken with him."
We ended up seeing a couple people that my friend and I knew.
"Afterwards, we went back to my friends house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog."
"Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house."
My brother came to visit me last month.
We planned a really fun weekend with my other brother.
"We were going to take the train, but when we got to the station we saw the line we needed wasn't running, so we had to walk."
"We had a nice dinner, but when we left it was pouring rain."
My brother came to visit me for his birthday.
We went to Navy pier and walked around.
On the way back it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella.
Recently I was playing in a local basketball tournament with my team.
We won the first two games easily without much trouble.
Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals.
"Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half."
"In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee."
Right away I knew it was bad.
"After the game I went to the hospital and they immediately told me I had ruptured a ligament, and would not be able to do much of anything for a while."
"Thankfully I had surgery quickly, but was unable to walk for a few weeks which was quite frustrating."
A couple months ago during summer I was playing basketball in a tournament.
I remember it was like the 3rd or 4th game when something bad happened.
The other team missed a shot and someone on my team got the rebound.
I started running towards my basket and my teammate threw me the ball.
"I went up for a lay up with my right hand to fake my opponent, then tried to finish with my left."
Because of this I came down really hard on my right knee.
I don't know if it was the angle I landed on or what but I felt a huge strain in my knee as soon as I landed.
I later on went to the doctor to check it out and found out I ruptured a ligament in my knee.
I had to get surgery to repair it and couldn't walk again for a couple of weeks.
"Surgery went well, but the doctor found the injury was worse than expected."
It also turns out the recovery is way longer than expected.
It turns out that this will be a 3-6 months recovery process.
I didn't expect it when she mentioned how I have been a source of inspiration to her and about how I have been hardwired with the will to go on.
I was moved to tears while she talked about me.
I wanted to attend her graduation but it coincided with my younger brother's high school graduation so I couldn't go.
I got to catch up with some other classmates from high school who I hadn't seen in a while too.
"Unexpectedly, she talked about me in her speech and my own accomplishments."
I originally wanted to attend the ceremony but I had to go out of town for my brother's graduation.
When I got to the party I saw some classmates that I hadn't seen for many years.
Then she started talking about me!
"I was out and about on my day off, when by complete chance I got a craving for a candy bar."
"It was then, in the flour aisle, where I ran into her."
"However, she looked strikingly similar to my mother."
"She was a very interesting woman, and surprisingly, she wasn't taken aback by anything I said."
We decided to grab a donut and a coffee and chat.
She wanted to give me a cake she had made and i declined.
She wanted to give me a cake she had made and i declined.
"Our cooking class in Florence in Meri’s Tuscan kitchen was a highlight topped off with a full day boat tour along the Sorrento Coast, Capri Island, and Nero Bay with Giovanni and having lunch at Conca Del Sogno on our last day."
"Additionally, to our surprise, we receive a hand written letter with welcome treats & wine at each hotel!"
My husband got a huge bonus sent to him in the mail as a check.
"We both knew, we'd be off to Vegas for some fun!"
"I eventually would win $1,800."
"Me and my husband woke up one day to an email on his phone that had said 'You have been working hard this past week, I will give you a slight raise on your paycheck.'"
"When we looked at how much money we had, we had a lot of extra money."
We both thought that this was intentional so we decided that the next day we will plan a surprise trip to Las Vegas.
Later that night we tried to gamble more but I could not find any of our money.
But just then we saw all the pictures lining up and we won over a thousand dollars.
If I didn't pass the test I would have been demoted and I would have had my pay lowered.
I started to calm down when I noticed that the questions were things I was very familiar with.
Your boss or someone else is supposed to help you but I was on my own.
I was one course away from finishing the first section of 2 and i could not pass the quiz for the life of me.
I had to use that twice.
I passed it first try and got that monkey off my back.
I had to fight with how awful the computer program was.
You only had three times to pass (and the questions changed) before you had to request a reset.
I used my three attempt and could not figure out how to request a reset.
I ended up being there for 6 hours.
4 months ago I had the most amazing experience of my life.
I decided to take a few weeks off from work and just reconnect with myself and nature.
After much research I wound up agreeing to go dog mushing around the interior of Alaska with a native of the area.
We took a break right before the downhill to cross the river and when i looked up i noticed a moose just across the bank.
"The dogs were so tired they didn't even notice, the more i watched this big cow moose eat off the trees i noticed a calf emerge from the woods behind her."
"While i was watching the moose i heard a scream not too far off which sounded like a cat, and indeed it was."
Only 45-50 yards away from the moose was a full grown lynx walking the bank of the river.
Just when i thought this free nature show couldn't get any better a second lynx walked out from the woods and began a mating call with the first lynx.
As I looked out to my amazement I saw a baby moose struggling through the snow.
"Next, I heard a strange sound I hadn’t heard before."
"As I looked out I saw something trotting through the woods, not far from the moose."
To my surprise it was a lynx.
"I noticed another lynx not far behind the first one, it was an amazing sight."
"I was anxious because I never had Korean BBQ, but I decided to go anyway."
"It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out."
The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house.
Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her.
But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them.
"This event was significant to me as well because I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I got to see the new place she moved out to."
"Dear Diary, Today was a great day!"
I was so excited when I found out that mine had won!
i were select as an chief designer for new product used in automotive parts.
i made high potential and efficiency obtained that was quiet surprising.
i were promoted after the success of my project.
I started raising my hand o speak as often as possible.
I developed a workshop.
I received the best news that I could have hoped for.
I am all good and cancer free!
When the results returned the doctor saw I had a high PSA count.
"After a biopsy, the doctor informed me that I have prostate cancer."
"Like i said in my statement before, i found out i had prostate cancer in March 2019."
Had my prostate removed in August.
I got him some bugs  for a gift .
We have made this event a tradition in our family.
"I have a younger grandson his brother, and we have a yard bbq party for him also now in August."
We all so much look forward to our yearly bbq now.
I have wore out my bbqer and need to get a new one for next year.
