"My dog has cancer. She has cancer in her nose, and over the next few months im going to watch my childhood friend struggle to breathe more and more until the end. Is this all my life is going to be, just watching things I love suffer and die? Whats the fucking point.","I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help. *-hugs-*",2,2,2
Just cut myself for the first time. I've been drinking and i don't know how I feel,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down. Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please let me know if you want to talk. You are a strong person &lt;3",2,2,2
