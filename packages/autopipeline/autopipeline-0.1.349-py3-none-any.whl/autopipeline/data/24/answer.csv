"Askolnick:  Redefining Neutral Point of View 
Askolnick: In a message posted to Keith Tyler's User Talk page, [] Dreadlocke flatters Keith for his efforts to make the Natasha Demkina article ""neutral,"" and then shows just what his idea of neutrality is. He recommends linking the article to what he calls a ""fairly neutral"" web page:
Hi Keith, an external control article that looks fairly neutral is from the Discovery Channel."" []
""Fairly neutral""?  See for yourself: The Discovery Channel article begins:
""Natasha Demkina has an extraordinary gift that means she can quite literally see right through people. Her story sounds like it has come straight from the pages of a science fiction comic book, but doctors have yet to disprove her amazing abilities. Natasha is able to look into people’s bodies and correctly diagnose their medical problems, without any help from ultra-sound or x-ray equipment.""
Neutral?! The Discovery Channel program is primarily about a scientific test of Natasha's claims that found no evidence of such powers. Yet this article states that Natasha can ""quite literally see right through people's bodies and correctly diagnose their medical problems."" It makes absolutely NO mention that she was tested by researchers, or that they concluded she is doing nothing more than using a cold reading technique commonly used by astrologers, palm readers, and other fortune-telling charlatans.
Dreadlocke insists that he's only interested in establishing a neutral point of view in the Natasha Demkina article. Yet he calls the Discovery Channel article, ""fairly neutral.""  Nothing that he's ever posted here shows his own lack of neutrality as much as that statement. The Discovery Channel article claims that Natasha has supernatural powers that she is using to help people find out what is making them sick, without any mention that scientific researchers tested her and found only evidence of deception. He calls this a ""fairly neutral"" point of view.
It's clear why he is so unhappy with the Natasha Demkina article. And it should be clear that he won't be happy until it is as ""neutral"" as the Discovery Channel article, which claims that Natasha Demkina is helping people with her amazing paranormal powers, while doctors are mystified. Apparently, in Dreadlocke's lexicon, ""NPOV"" means ""agrees with him."" ",True
"Mindjuicer:  Made major NPOV changes to introduction 
Mindjuicer: Former introduction made ad-hominem attacks on Craig and was inaccurate (NLP is a widely-accepted form of psychology).  Does the intro on general relativity point out that Einstein was a patent clerk?  Describing Craig as a realtor in the intro is appalling editing.  Craig's income method should appear later in the article as part of an explanation of EFT's growth in popularity, largely due to a description of the method being freely available.
The intro also implied that 'science' had ""concluded"" that EFT worked only in terms of explainable mechanisms.  The irony of implying a single study can prove a mechanism was not lost on me.
The intro is still strongly on the negative side and thus breaches the NPOV rule.  It needs further work.

"AndersFeder: How could Wikipedia face these challenges? Scrap the current monolithic article model, and begin publishing incremental edits in wiki_link instead. Make a wiki_link. (I realize this term is already used in wiki_link, which sounds more like wiki_link content edited in a traditional wiki.) This way, independent third-parties could serve customized edit filters into the main Wikipedia database. For instance, one site could serve only articles composed of edits made by scholars (together with minor edits by non-scholars perhaps, to allow for things like spelling corrections). Another site could serve only articles composed of edits approved by a board of editors whose particular editorial style you like. Yet another site could serve edits based on mass moderation. And yet another site (say, wikipedia.org) could allow you to select from all the available edits to an article in order to tailor the article which meets your exact quality demands. Companies like Google could mirror the edit database and apply their own proprietary search and ranking technologies. Contributors could discuss and evaluate single edits in detail, and so on. Wikis has opened up editing. Now let's open up viewing as well.

"Wiqi55: ... and according to Thomas W. Arnold, they are ""so rare that some writers have even doubted the existence of any.""
I'm not sure why the above is being removed. I wouldn't mind removing it, but since we have a reliable source stating how historically rare and insignificant those images were, one would think that another RS should be introduced first (claiming the opposite). In fact, 4-5 books in 1400+ years is extremely rare, and some poetry books created for private use is by definition ""historical trivia"". I thought the above quote aptly expresses this fact. ()
Doc Tropics: per my edit summaries (which I had thought very clear): The source may be reliable, and no one questions that images were scarce, but the number of RS scholars that doubted their existence is too small to feature in the introduction so prominently. At the same time, the phrase that I restored (I'm not the original author) ""''...appearing almost entirely in the private medium of the Persian miniature book illustration, and those of other Islamic cultures.''"" conveys more information, and in a more thorough manner.

"Sitush: Genetics are a waste of time for articles about Indian history. Have you noticed how many qualifiers there are even in the bit you quoted, eg: ""may have"", ""suggests"", ""according to"". And it is mixing research on genetics with research on ancient texts - most ancient Indian texts are widely regarded to be more fiction than fact. That the caste system existed in the ancient world is not disputed even by the likes of Zwart. What the contemporary people are saying is that the British administrative efforts, driven often by Brahmin urgings, served to intensify the significance of caste in a modern context, to reinforce boundaries within the system etc and thus made it more ""rigid"". There was a certain amount of fluidity in the pre-British system, whereby people's caste roles were redefined. That, for example, is why there are so many ""degraded kshatriyas"". Or so the postcolonialists say.
In a society where there was little geographic movement, it is inevitable that the DNA profile will be fairly narrow for a considerable period of time. One doesn't need a degree in genetics to realise this and, generally, there is much rubbish written about genetics in the historic Indian context, usually by people who conduct very limited surveys for a socio-political purpose. At the end of the day, we simply do not know and never will because we all have the DNA of millions of our predecessors, and none at all from some with whom we are related. Basically, never use these reports because they are couched in such terms as to be meaningless for our purposes. -

This view is not what the lead reflects. With regard to its origin, to the uninitiated, caste is ' thought of as an ancient fact of Hindu life' and 'is the result of the British colonial regime'. I have mentioned it earlier as well. It is the first sentence on the origins of caste system in the lead and it directly comes to Colonialism as if there has been no time period such as ancient, and pre - British India. I assume the article is not only about the caste system in Colonial and post colonial India. Further the lead has 5 references to affirmative action based on caste, which I believe is POV pushing.

"Rjensen:  Bengali famine, Sen, Bowbrick 
AidWorker: I think you have missed the point. Wikipedia is about verifiable evidence, and this article has 41 primary sources, which carry infinitely more weight than what any modern commentator thinks, as well as 22 commentators, most of whom spent far more time on this than Sen, months or years rather than days. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) that the yield statistics at the time were meaningless. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) that there was widespread hunger in the production districts. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) on interference with the supply system. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) showing that the Bengal Government had the same diagnosis as Sen. And any competent agricultural economist will do the calculations to see how much more people would have to eat to cause a famine in the way postulated by Sen – it is a simple calculation, not a matter of counting citations. Sen got nearly all his facts for his from the Famine Inquiry Commission report, though he was accused of misstating more than 30 of them and neither he nor anyone else has denied this – he avoided the issue in his reply to Bowbrick. His “causes of famine” were lifted verbatim from the Famine Inquiry Commission (without acknowledgement!) but he had not read the report carefully enough to realize that both the FIC and Braund had presented them as hypotheses to be tested – and the ones Sen based his arguments on were rejected as being completely contradicted by the evidence. Not by one modern commentator, but by a mass of contemporary evidence and analysis. But the point of Wikipedia is that it identifies the controversies and the sources: if you have the population statistics and consumption statistics, it takes 5 minutes to see if a famine could have been caused in the way Sen says. It takes you 2 or 3 hours to see whether Sen or Bowbrick is right on what Sen’s sources really said. The article does not take a position on this: it is up to you to do the work and draw your own conclusions. ",True

...As late as this summer, when Rossi’s story seemed thoroughly debunked, he continued to make outlandish claims about his E-Cat. He looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end. Maybe he’d even conned himself...

...To my astonishment, after three days of asking every cold-fusion researcher in the house, I couldn’t find a single person willing to call Rossi a con man. The consensus was that he had something, even if he didn’t understand why it worked or how to control it. The more I learned, the more confused I became. Could Rossi actually have something real?

So Steve Featherstone '''DOES NOT''' conclude that the E-Cat seemed ""thoroughly debunked"" and that Rossi ""looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end"": the article continues by affirming quite the opposite.

Of course it's gonna be long, he's a main character. By contrast, Simone's article isn't long because her part of the story ended when she died (she has a past, no future). It might read like a story because Heroes is presented like a comic book. Perhaps some better condensing of the infomation would help to solve this and to make it more encyclopedic. ",True

"Danish Expert:  Why did Greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis? 
Thanatos666: I said I wouldn't but you keep writing lengthy essays so...
Your analyses keep missing
that Greece does not have its own currency, unlike e.g. the UK
that the Greek debt problem is predominantly of an external nature, unlike e.g. the one of the UK, having been financed through capital inflows from abroad which stopped and/or reversed after a major recent global event
that a very common step, if not the historical norm, in such cases is simply to default, i.e. that sovereign defaults are very common historically, that they aren't a negligible exception
that there is also the other historical precedent and analogue of countries exiting currency unions (and/or pegs, i.e. currency nions of whichever form, e.g. the Gold Standard).
Your analyses keep assuming
that the Greek crisis is just a severe case of liquidity problem/crisis and not of an insolvency one
that other countries or organisations actually tried to help save Greece and not just themselves and/or the system (they're not oblided to do so but let's say that lying about it is also not obligatory)
that many austerity policies taken by the Greek Governments during the crisis were taken in order to indeed save Greece and not the interests of the people in power.
Your analyses keep presenting
the actions taken by other countries and/or international organisations as having been indeed taken indeed in order to save Greece and as being indeed objectively necessary for Greece, i.e. that TINA
misrepreseting thus major steps or order of events that took place and ommitting the advice of
many economomists, analysts,... who've claimed that other steps should have be taken instead of or in a different order than the ones actually taken
and also misrepresenting actual beliefs of many people and/or groups of power
e.g. that in the broader context beyond Greeece, the confidence fairy and expansionary austerity in a time of crisis was/is thought to actually be a law of nature (e.g. in the aforementioned UK),
e.g. that many people and organisations actually believe(d), focusing this time in the narrower context, that Greece would actually be saved if only it did austerity and/or structural reforms.
A very clear example of this is that
even if we assume Greece remaining in the EZ as being objectivelly necessary, which we shouldn't, and
even if we assume that Greece not defaulting unilaterally as being a necessary fact of live/history, which we shouldn't, and
even if we assume that structural reforms an/or austerity would indeed be a solution and/or necessary and/or not actually bad, counterproductive for the actual economy and interests of Greece, of the Greek people, which we shouldn't
that there are tons of people that have claimed that the commonly, mutually agreed upon haircut should have come first (and be of a major magnitude) when in reality it came much later (twice or 1 point something times) and either by itself and/or as a consequence of the delay it was of an inadequate magnitude worsening thus even more, much more, the already unbelievable mess and conundrum. And it has also been claimed thus, that this happened in order to save the foreign banks etc. and/or countries, '''NOT''' @#%@% Greece, that in reality other countries were extending and pretending, kicking the can down the road so that they could firewall and ringfence themselves and their banks, saving the lenders that shouldn't have lent Greece such huge loans in the first place. It has also been claimed that the politicians of these countries sold, presented, portrayed saving these banks, funds etc. to their citizens as a magnanimous and benevolent action, solution, as saving (unworthy) Greece and Greeks from destruction because otherwise they couldn't have persuaded their taxpayers/citizens (or anyway would have a very difficult task before them trying to do this) to save the banks and the rest of the financial system one/two... more time(s) after the global crisis.

"Skipsievert: Latest clean copy
Sustainability, in a broad sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely,'''wrong words... maintain... and indefinitely''' although it is now '''you mean in this article now?''' most frequently used in connection with biological and human systems.'''says who'''?
In an ecological context, sustainability can be defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future.[4]'''Why not just start out with that?''' '''that is sourced to the U.N. and as a citation that is fine... citations in articles leads are fine. You are referencing the U.N. again... and again here. Could be a conflict of interest as editors involved in the U.N. movement could be biased..... no?'''
Sustainability has become a complex term that can be applied to almost every facet of life on Earth, particularly the many different levels of biological organization, such as; wetlands, prairies and forests and is expressed in human organization concepts, such as; ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities, and human activities and disciplines, such as; sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture and renewable energy. '''There is no such thing presently as ''sustainable cities'' so where does that come from? Could someone name a sustainable city?'''
For humans to live sustainably, the Earth's resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. '''This is not actually a fact and means almost nothing in context''' However, there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return keep human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits.'''This leads magically into U.N. material then, which should be in a separate area'''
Since the 1980s, through the influence of the United Nations global program for sustainable development, the idea of human sustainability has become increasingly associated with the integration of economic, social and environmental spheres to “meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” '''This is biased, and not neutral and is not appropriate in this section.''' Could these obvious things be corrected for starters? Is it really a good idea to advertise the U.N. as the one to integrate economics... social ... and environmental spheres??. That is pretty overtly an advert for an organization and not neutral in the least. The article is not called ''Sustainability and the U.N.'' That would be a different article.  
Granitethighs: Thanks Skip, we need a ""devils advocate"". Opening sentence: ""maintain"" is a good general ""sustain"" word ""indefinitely"" well ... maybe, not fussed. I agree with your ""says who?"" On the UN: so far as the article is concerned I am not in the least bit concerned whether the UN is good, bad, indifferent, peddling propaganda, a front for dark forces or whatever. Its influence is undeniable and a fact (witness the constant reference to its definition of sustainability). I think you have an issue here and I'm not sure where you are coming from. This statement is in no way promoting the UN simply objectively stating its influence. So far as I'm concerned this statement is a neutral observation of fact. The other comments do not really deserve reply - if you think they are critical I will - I think they are already answered here.   ",True

"Folken de Fanel: The article says ""considerable speculation"".
The sources sandpiper wants to add reflect only ''one'' theory, and the source used is the theory itself, posted on blogs and forums.
There was a poll, in which the majority was against the inclusion of theories explaining the title, because it could influence the reader and it was non-neutral: it was therefore decided to remove all theories from the article, and to let the readers form their opinion by themeselves with the help of the Hallows article.
What is then the point of having the same theory, using the same reference that the previously deleted content used, in the article while it was made clear that no theory was wanted here, so that the readers would not be influenced by the beliefs of one or 2 editors ? It's still a npov breach, because it imposes a certain view to the reader: why only one theory cited, if there is ""considerable speculation"" ?
Also, why citing directly the blogs and forums in which the theory originated ? It's the very example of unreliable sources, according to WP:SELF.
What I propose is to have only reliable, perfectly ''external'' (that is, not entirely related to the HP world) and neutral sources, and a web article of the Washington Post appears to me the best solution. The ref I added perfectly reflects the fact that no one really knows what the title means, and that everyone is trying to guess.

''From Time Immemorial'' p. 188, ""In Palestine, [it] was reported: 'It is a fact that the Jewish Subjects... do not enjoy the privileges granted to them. This Evil may in general be traced...: I.

"142.176.177.164: Just a quick comment thanking the above-mentioned for his unbiased and obviously belabored attempt to mediate this disaster. The article in current form looks ok, although I must agree with Ta bu shi da yu that many of the critical claims in the article (those leveling criticism at Jesus' existence) are decidedly POV and are unsubstantiated.
I have a question - does the fact that 2,000 years of human history have been sharply, distinctly, and without question marked and shaped by the concept of this person, Jesus (even our calendar is purpotedly based on his arrival) count as evidence that he lived? It does to me. Perhaps this should be mentioned. By and large, supposed ""experts"" may claim Jesus didn't exist, but really Wil Durant's point is the same as is made by the vast majority of people who have read the Gospel (especially nominal Christians, but even non-Christians like Ghandi pointed to the wisdom of the writings as laudable) that the story and principles presented in the Gospels are by far much too compelling and honest, even after first read, to be discarded out of hand as a forgery, mythology, con-job or fairytale. People died, even then in the first century, because of their belief in that person. Do con artists sacrifice themselves based on the ""ideals"" of their lies? Never. It's easy to tear down.

I really don't see the point in Lancaster's griping here since SNPs are often used in place of clade names as a quick means of identification. E1b1b1 simply becomes M35 when pressed for time.

RTC: Quoting from http://www.oism.org/cdp/V10_05.htm:
The most toxic substances known to man are made by bacteria. Contrary to allegations by PSR, et al., plutonium is ``not a world-class toxicant,'' writes T. Don Luckey in a June 20 letter to Chemical and Engineering News.
When injected intraperitoneally into mice, the LD50 (the dose that causes 50% deaths in 30 days) is about the same as that of the vitamin pantothenic acid.
On a scale in which plutonium has a toxicity = 1, the toxicities of other materials are:
mercury chloride 100
strychnine 1,000
actinomycin D 10,000
tetrodotoxin 100,000
perfringens A toxin 1,000,000
pestis toxin 10,000,000
shigella toxin 100,000,000
botulinal E toxin 1,000,000,000
tetanus toxin 100,000,000,000
botulinal B toxin 1,000,000,000,000
botulinal D toxin 10,000,000,000,000
The EPA is more concerned about carcinogens than toxins, but plutonium doesn't make the grade there either. Plutonium-contaminated workers have a lower total cancer mortality: 88% that of unexposed workers.

"Tariqabjotu: Borders vs. territory
Okedem: However, in the sentence in question, it is discussing armistice lines set after the 1948 War. This ''was'' only temporary control, certainly until the UN brokered the peace by which they would be recognized as the boundaries between national control. It's very simple: when the Israeli military (or, conversely, the Jordanian military, if you like) crossed the boundaries for the territory that had been allocated to the Jewish state (Palestinian state), it was expanded the territory under its control. It was ''not'' expanding its internationally recognized borders; the UN, rather than recognizing the military advances, could have said, ""everyone go back home, where home means what was allocated to you under the partition plan."" (Yes, I know; the UN would never do anything that required that much spine, but they do have the authority to do it.) It was only when the UN recognized the armistice lines that it can be said that the internationally recognized borders of Israel/the Jewish State were expanded. 
Tegwarrior, you edit makes it look as if the Palestinian refugee issue has one clear cut reason. But that's not true.
If you want to talk about so-called massacres, you might want to tell the readers that Arabs performed a whole lot of them, instead of the false impression you give them now.

Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes.

Dutch cuisine by comparison is less developed (raw herring and bitterballen are classics). A standard Dutch dish is mussels with bread, not moules frites. It's pointless attempting to claim this dish as a classic dish originating in the Netherlands. Here is a source about ""Les Belges"" which discusses Moules Frites at length as a Belgian icon:

"Authalic: While I was looking into the various ways that relativity is accounted for in the Global Positioning System, I came across one correction which should probably be mentioned here.  Nearly all of the relativity effects are accounted for at the control station and in the clock frequencies, but there is a small correction which takes place in the receiver.
The satellite orbits are slightly elliptical (e=0.02) which causes the velocity of the satellites and their positions relative to earth to change over their complete orbits.  It is my understanding that the relativity effect arising from the elliptical orbit is slight (it could lead to a ranging error of ~14 meters out of more than 20,000 km).  It is also regular and easily predictable.  I read a few sources which state that a correction factor is included in the satellite message and these corrections are performed in the receiver software.  As a result, they're invisible in most user applications.  Search for ""eccentricity"" in these sources: ,  (see '''The Eccentricity Correction''' section), and .  -

The cited reference connects the claim not to receivers, but to the elements of the control segment of the GPS system.  As you have correctly pointed out (and I mentioned a few weeks ago, see above), the receivers do apply a by-the-book relativistic eccentric correction, amounting to some 15 metres.

"46.208.234.40: As is well known in the ME/CFS world, it is greatly in the interests of the disability insurance industry to make ME/CFS look as if it were an ""all in the mind"" disorder caused by psychogenic or biopsychosocial factors, rather than a disease with organic biological causes. This is because disability insurance rules generally stipulate that disability due to biological disease is covered for lifelong disability support payments where necessary, but disability due to mental health disorders are not covered for lifelong support. Thus the insurance industry can save billions in disability payouts if they make it appear that ME/CFS is an ""all in the mind"" mental disorder, rather than the organic biologically-caused disease that most scientific biomedical researchers view it to be. Indeed, the psychiatrists who have most promoted the idea that ME/CFS is an ""all in the mind""  biopsychosocial condition — people like Simon Wessely, and Prof Peter White — have been paid by disability insurance companies for their work, in spite of the obvious conflict of interest.
Thus the fact that this article has a strong bias towards presenting ME/CFS as an biopsychosocial condition (a bias which is not supported by any science) suggests that some of the main editors here who are promoting the biopsychosocial view may be paid stooges for the disability insurance industry. So can people like ,  and others here who have a pro-biopsychosocial stance categorically state that they are not being paid by the disability insurance industry, and are not receiving any form of benefit from this or any other industry or outside interests? There are several people who are persistent editors on this ME/CFS page, who work hard and tirelessly to make ME/CFS look as if it were a biopsychosocial illness.
Wikipedia does have many editors who are paid by corporate interests to manipulate articles; see here for example: Some People Get Paid a Lot of Money to Edit Wikipedia Pages. Wikipedia rules state that paid editors who receive compensation for their contributions to Wikipedia, either directly or indirectly, MUST disclose who is paying them to edit. So that is why I am asking the editors of this page who have a pro-biopsychosocial view of ME/CFS and a major interest in this article to declare whether or not they receive any form of payment, benefit or compensation for their work on this article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

This is bad in principle, and bad in the case of philosophy, where there is no complete agreement about what the branches are.  But one step at a time.  It is quite amazing to see this article with only 2 edits in an 8 hour period.  Best.  
Peter Damian (original account):  Let me give two different quotations from that page, to illustrate my point.  The first is by Maritain: ""Philosophy is the science by which the natural light of reason studies the first causes or highest principles of all things – is, in other words, the science of things in their first causes, in so far as these belong to the natural order.""  That is an attempt at a definition, which is half Aristotle (the first causes) and half Aquinas (the natural light of reason).  It would be controversial now, but there is no doubt it aims to be a definition.  By contrast Russell says ""The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as to seem not worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.""  Which is not a definition but a witty, and half ironic remark about a certain kind of philosophy.   The page in question ( definitions of philosophy) mixes these two kinds of statement about philosophy in roughly equal proportion.  ",True
"Vizjim:  (Please also see the discussion immediately above).  The idea of the sentences that introduce this list is to try to strike a balance between purists such as the user Amerindianarts, whose comments above originally suggest limiting the list only to enrolled members (as per the IACA), and those who would include writers with very vague and highly disputed links to indigenous ancestry.  I think that the idea of an inclusive list needs to be explicitly explained, but then counterbalanced by mentioning those writers who do not qualify for inclusion.  Unfortunately the issue of who is/is not an American Indian writer can get really quite fraught, and there is no gold standard of NPOV-ness that can be reached, so I have tried to word the standfirst to keep such wars away from this page.

To restore balance in the depth of coverage, someone needs to do some more on his earlier life and post-war events - especially his transition to his modern role during the MacArthur administration.  (Not me! I'll stick to 1940 to '45 where I know what I'm talking about.)

"E. Ripley: Okay, just to refocus things a bit.  Let's concentrate on the disagreements in the first paragraph.  I've cleaned it up removing refs etc. for readability.  The anon is seeking to have the first paragraph say:  ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people.''
3RingCircus would prefer an opening paragraph that says this:  ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling clothing offered in large or extended sizes (see plus-sized clothing). Females working as plus-size models range from U.S. size 8 and upwards, and are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, i.e. body acceptance commentary, stock photography, and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products, sunglasses, footwear and watches, etc. Therefore plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.''
The two first sentences really convey the same thing.  Plus-size models primarily model plus-size garments.  Then 3ring goes on to describe what size plus-size models typically are, and expands on the idea that they do not only model plus-sized clothing, but rather items such as watches and the like.  (I would go even farther, and point out that people who model plus-sized clothing often are not really plus-sized themselves, but let's not muddy the water).  I think the first sentence we largely have agreement on, save some minor wording issues.  The question really is whether or not to include the rest that 3ring wants.  Anon, can you tell me why you dislike the rest of what 3ring wants to include in the opener?  It doesn't really seem unreasonable to me generally speaking, but maybe I'm missing some nuance.  — \
3RingCircus: E.Ripley, it would seem I have to be very specific here.  I realize that my posts and work-it-out-in-writing thought process make it dificult to follow my intent, so to summarize and be really clear (and please excuse my lack of knowledge on blockquoting and proper layout).
Prior to the edit war with Anon/IP:79.97.166.36, the opening sentence of the article was as follows:'' '''Plus-size model''' is a term internationally applied to a woman who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed and marketed specifically for larger body sizes and types (see plus-size clothing)''.  This article's editors had previously (see: [Section 6, para 4/5/6]) reached a consensus regarding the wording of the first sentence with particular regards to mention of plus-size clothing, i.e. that it be as unspecific as practical, if mention be made at all.
Anonymous User/IP 79.97.166.36 edited this statement to read: ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (see plus-size clothing).'' and reverted it a number of times to this wording after editors altered it on the basis that 'fat or overweight' was pejorative or not accurately describing who wears plus size clothing.   After I raised discussion on whether the phrase ""fat or overweight"" was pejorative, User 24.215.23.237 wrote in Section 32 on 4Sept09 that  ''79.97.166.36 is being selective in his definitions. The full OED has two different defintions, one for ""plus size,"" one for ""plus-sized"". They are as follows:
plus size n. and adj. orig. U.S. (a) n. a large size of clothing; (b) adj. (usu. with hyphen) = plus-sized adj.
plus-sized adj. orig. U.S. (of clothing) sized to fit an overweight or fat person, usually a woman; euphem. (of a person, usually a woman) overweight; fat.  Since we are being very particular here, this article is titled ""plus-size model,"" therefore there is no reason not to use the first definition.  Also, a useful fix to this controversy is '''not to speculate as to the persons for whom plus-size clothing is marketed'''. (After all, even male transvestites purchase plus-size female clothing, and they may not be fat or overweight at all, simply large due to their gender.)  '''Therefore, to sat (sic) that a plus-size model is engaged in ""modelling large sizes of clothing"" is the most accurate statement that one can make, fits with the OED definition, and does not engage in questionable and unnecessary speculation as to the identity of the individuals who purchase the products'''. 24.215.23.237 (talk) ''
I thought this statement was a logical and sound interpretation of the OED and its best applicability to the article, so I agreed with User 24.215.23.237 as to the irrelevance of Anon's edits, and made the following comment: ""''... the size range of agency career models (i.e. not internet glamour or 'hobby' models) completely separates them from the sizing of plus-sized clothing and therefore there should be no more confusing discussion of plus-size clothing nor who that clothing is made for.'' "" 3RingCircus 124.184.249.159 (talk) .  Although in retrospect my comment reads a little heavyhanded and 'pronouncement-like', I felt that a consensus on the matter was reached between editors of the article both now and previously, as it was directly in-line with consensus reached as described above in Section 6, and so I adjusted the article accordingly.  Shortly thereafter, Anon/User 79.97.166.36 reverted the opening sentence to their original edit, as they have continually done since their first edit to this article.
To date: Anon/User 79.97.166.36 blatantly disregards prior consensus reached, reverts with no regard for other editors' work, and has received no consensus relating to their edits.  Whenever this matter of clothing sizes comes up, even if it is discussed differently and among different editors, the same consensus is reached - that mention of specifics be avoided, as it has its own article for such business. I remind Anon/User 79.97.166.36 that consensus is a fundamental policy for Wiki editors.  Not one single person has agreed with Anon that this sentence, ""Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (see plus-size clothing)"" should remain as it stands on this article, or at plus-size clothing where it better fits.
E.Ripley, I request only that the original opening sentence'' '''Plus-size model''' is a term internationally applied to a woman who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed and marketed specifically for larger body sizes and types (see plus-size clothing)'' be reinserted (sentences following can remain as updated), and that Anon/User 79.97.166.36 be cautioned to stop editing against consensus.

So what does the community think, should we go with the major city that the source says or the smaller areas.

"Cadwgan Gedrych:  Self Defense 
Cadwgan Gedrych: Smoke and mirrors. Neither Dirk nor EMS could tell us how Galileo's clocks differ from Einstein's. And yet this is essential to any sort of understanding of the difference between classical and Einsteinian flat space-time physics!
I do wish to thank EMS for his clarification re the w = c - v, as far as it went; but it quickly bogged down again.
EMS said:
""It should also be noted that at the beginning of the following paragraph Einstein states: ''But this [c-v] result conflicts with the principle of relativity ...''.   So Cadwgan claiming that Einstein says that the speed of light is ''c''-''v'' is just plain deceitful.""
If I am just plain deceitful, then how did I win my first case against the Wiki article?
If I am just plain deceitful, then how did I win all of my SR arguments in the Newsgroups?
It seems to me that it's EMS who's just plain deceitful because he omitted my prior statement here that it matters not what Einstein claimed about the validty his result w = c - v, but all that matter was the simple fact that Einstein ''derived'' this result on paper using two clocks.
I did not say that Einstein said that the speed of light is c. I said that he said that the speed of light would be and could be c given the absolutely synchronous clocks of classical physics.
This is not even hinted at in the Wiki article.
I also said that the only reason we get c today is by definition, and this clearly has nothing to do with physics because it is untestable.
Let EMS tell us why no one has ever used two same-frame clocks to measure the one-way speed of light? This is clearly the definitive one-way light speed experiment, but it has yet to be performed, and the Wiki article fails to mention this extremely important fact, let alone tell us the why's and wherefore's!
EMS wrote:
"": In his talk page, Cadwgan Gedrych wrote:
 ''You claim above that things such as the MMx confirmed the second postulate. ... Yes, any null result is consistent with the second postulate''.""
This also seems deceitful. Anyone here should know that merely ""being consitent with"" does not mean ""physically explain by.""
Dirk pitifully attempts to cite essentially the same thing on two web pages to make his case look better, but he has no case at all.
Doesn't anyone here think it odd that Dirk has nothing to say about the topic at hand, namely, the second postulate?
Doesn't anyone here think it rather strange that Dirk has not simply pointed out which clock of the 4 reads two different times at once?
Doesn't anyone here think it weird that Dirk simply ignored my simple but critical challenge re Einstein's vs Galileo's clocks?
Doesn't anyone here think it sad that no one except Dirk ""sees"" an error in the  little 4-clock experiment?
Since Dirk continues to insist on posting off-topic, it seems that one way to put a stop to this is by challenging him to bring in at least one other person who agrees with him about the above-mentioned 4-clock case. ",True

 It doesn't matter if it's unique. MANY of those terms have seeped into Civvie speech and are no longer unique.
 It doesn't matter that it didn't orginiate with the military, it's STILL a slang term used in the Navy/Coast Guard.
Rossami:  Actually, it matters a great deal.  This is, after all, supposed to be an ''encyclopedia'' article on ''military'' slang, not a mere definition list.  To be more precise, this is not a concordance of all slang that happens to be used by the military.  This list was created to describe slang terms which are either unique to the military ''or'' which can be verifiably shown to have originated with the military.  It must meet one of those two criteria or it has no place in the list.
 No one disputes that the phrase ""dead in the water"" is used by the military.  We even used the term in the Army.  But it's also in wide use outside the military and has been for a very long time.  The military is made up of people who came from all walks of life.  They bring their language with them into the service.  Slang that happens to be used by military people is not synonymous with military slang.
 Of course, the other inclusion criteria is slang which originated with the military before moving out to wider usage.  Unfortunately, I know of no reference demonstrating that ""dead in the water"" originated as a military slang phrase.  Until someone can cite a reliable source that this phrase ''originated'' with the military, it is inappropriate for this list.

"Miketwo:  Revert War 
Miketwo: '''I removed the following section'''
The term '''agnosticism''' and the related '''agnostic''' were coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869. As Huxley explains it, agnosticism is not about '''''knowledge''''' at all, because nobody can convince the world that he knows there is a god without producing logically satisfactory evidence of a god; agnostics are simply those who deny and repudiate any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to '''''believe''''' without logically satisfactory evidence .
This is one of the main issuses that still remain concerning agnosticism. The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic. When it comes right down to the facts of the matter theists in general do not generally say that they know that a god exists, only that they believe there might be one, and atheists in general do not say they know there is no god, only that they do not believe there might be one. And, as Huxley points out in ""Agnosticism and Christianity"" , agnosticism, in essence, is not really about knowledge at all, since nobody knows, it is about the denial and repudiation of  any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence.
I removed it because:
 Radically changing the main definition of an article 2+ years in the making is too bold.  The previous definition has been forged of many arguments, and is pretty good at addressing the various interest groups' issues.
 Even that aside, the new section is badly written.  This is an encyclopedia, so conjecture of the form ""When it comes right down to the facts of the matter"" does not belong.  The use of no less than 6 commas in the last ""sentence"" is also pretty bad.  And finally, the sentence ""The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic"" is blatant point-of-view.  The issue is actually providing a definition of agnosticism, not analyzing it.

"DRR75:  The film is authentic 
DRR75: I do understand that the Patterson-Gimlin film is still in dispute to this day.  I saw a Bigfoot back in June of 1991 and that kind of opened the door to me to the whole Bigfoot phenomena.  When I was a small child I saw the film and was scared of it.  After my sighting I watched the Patterson-Gimlin film several dozen times and I concluded Bigfoot I saw that day in 1991 looked VERY CLOSE to the creature in the Patterson-Gimlin film.  The creature in the film was just under 7' and was a female due to the fact that it had breasts.  The one I saw was about 8' and a male I believe.  In the last few years the film has undergone digital analysis and examination and those that did the analysis COULD NOT determine that the film was faked.  Bigfoot researcher John Green back in 1967 shortly after the film was made went back to the site and filmed a stand-in model-Jim McClarin- walking the same path that the creature took as a reference to determine the height and weight of the creature in the film.  The two films were superimposed to show the difference between the two.  McClarin stood 6'.5"".  The creature in the film was taller and much more bulkier.  The arms on the creature are longer than a normal man's arms.  I recently viewed the film digitally enhanced at a meeting of the International Bigfoot Society.  I could see the muscles moving underneath the hair of the creature.  The creature walks with an unusual bent-knee gait that is almost impossible to imitate.  The late Dr. Grover Krantz tried once to imitate it but was unsuccessful.  Several anatomists have recently discovered some sort of injury on the creature's knee as it flexes its knee when it's walking.  I can see no seams on the creature that would indicate a costume.  Apes have a natural hair seam running down the length of their spines.  As to the feet in the film- the area that the creature walked in the film was on sand and very soft soil which stuck to the creature's feet, as it would to any animal or human for that matter that would be walking in soil like that with bare feet.  When the creature turns to look at the camera, it just doesn't move its head- it moves its entire upper torso in the direction of the cameraman- just as an ape would do.  The creature turned to look at the camera because Bob Gimlin had crossed the creek and trained his rifle on it after Patterson told him to cover him in case the creature was agressive.  That's why the creature turned to look at the camera.  If this creature was a man in a costume, why would he risk his life with Gimlin having a loaded rifle aimed at him?  That doesn't make sense.  Patterson ran out of film because the rest of the film in his camera had been used filming scenery for a documentary he wanted to do.  Before he could change the film in his rented camera the creature had disappeared into the woods.  Patterson and Gimlin did trail it but couldn't go any further because the creature's trail went into the mountains and they couldn't follow with their horses and they weren't logistically equipped to go up the mountain after the creature.  The film is shaky because Patterson was running after the creature while he was filming it and finally stabilized himself on a tree stump.  Patterson did not know anything about cameras or film speeds.  I have personally met Bob Gimlin and heard what he had to say about what Patterson filmed that day.  He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood creature and not some guy in a fur suit.  Gimlin never made any money whatsoever on the film.  I am not trying to say that what everyone else believes is wrong; I'm just saying what I know about the film and I believe it to be authentic.  This was suppossed to have been faked by an ex-rodeo cowboy?  Hardly.

"Resnjari:  New Lede (final wording after discussion). Vote: 
Resnjari: The expulsion of Cham Albanians from Greece was the forced migration of almost the entire Muslim Cham Albanian population from parts of the region of western Epirus toward the end of the Second World War to Albania (1944-1945). It occurred during the military operations of the Allied forces and after the withdrawal of the German units from the region. It was carried out by the Allies through elements of the Resistance National Republican Greek League (EDES) forces with the acquiescence of local British intelligence operatives. During the process, some 1,200 Cham Albanians were murdered and massacred and the estimated amount of Cham Albanians expelled from Epirus to Albania and Turkey varies: figures of 14,000, 19,000, 20,000 or 25,000. After the members of the community settled in Albania, instead of being treated as victims and have their rights protected, the local regime took a very distrustful view towards them and proceeded with arrests and exiles. The Cham Albanians thereafter were labelled as ""reactionaries"" and suffered a certain degree of persecution within Albania during the communist era.

"BernardL:  FYI: Chomsky on False Consciousness 
BernardL: For those interested last week I asked Chomsky in his forum some questions concerning criticisms associating his media analysis with the Marxist theory of false consciousness. If anyone wants to ask a credible related follow-up question I would be happy to forward it. I think it's safe to say that the critique based upon the ""false consciousness"" line of argument is a pretty spurious case of guilt by association.
Q: Some critics from the right (ie:Victor Davis Hansen) tend to dismiss your and Herman's media analysis referring to it as just a recycled version of the Marxist theory of false consciousness.
NC: You'd have to ask Hansen what perverse line of reasoning  more accurately, free association  led him to his conclusions.  Any sane and rational person can see that the analysis is just what is described: an institutional analysis that relies on relatively uncontroversial guided free market models  in fact, those that Hansen probably professes himself, even if he goes berserk when their consequences are exposed.
Q: While I realize that the term ""manufacturing consent"" actually originates from early American media theory,
NC: The term ""manufacturing consent"" is taken from Walter Lippmann.  He was not in this case constructing any media theory, but rather recommending what the ""responsible men"" (always including the author himself) should do to ensure that the ""ignorant and meddlesome outsiders"" (the public) don't interfere with the decisions of the responsible men for the public good (by definition).
Q: I would still like to know if you accept the comparison of your work to the doctrine of ""false consciousness."" And if not why?
NC: I don't know of any doctrine of ""false consciousness,"" apart from the trivial and uncontroversial fact that the doctrinal institutions of any society (including, for us, media, educational systems, churches, etc.) articulate and present systems of belief that commonly reflect the interests and goals of those who dominate the institutions  hardly a surprise.  If that's the comparison that is intended, sure.  What question could there be?
Q: I think Marcuse deserves much of the credit for developing some passing comments by Engels into a more substantial theory of ideology he terms false consciousness. On the face of it there are some similarities with your views. Marcuse adhered to the views of the young Marx who felt that capitalist social relations alienated humans from expressions of their ""species-being"", views for which you show some affinity in your ""Notes on Anarchism"" essay.
NC: I don't know of any substantive theories of ideology.  The ideas of the early Marx on alienation are pretty much drawn from the Enlightenment-Romantic intellectual environment of his day, often in very similar words.  I think these notions have a lot of value, and have written about them, in the essay you mention and elsewhere.
Q: For Marcuse, capitalism engendered ""false"" consciousness and ""false"" needs in the sense that they are unnatural. Do you agree with this line of argument?
NC: Putting aside Marcuse's contributions, there is a rich literature about the ways in which market systems and ""created wants"" were imposed, often by violence, on the general population, which bitterly resisted them, and still does.  Meanwhile the masters devised numerous ways to protect themselves from the destructive impact of the systems they were imposing on others.  That's a good part of the history of the past several centuries.  What is ""natural"" depends on unknown facts about human nature.  We do, however, know a lot about the resistance to the doctrines and institutions imposed by force.  I don't know what line of argument there is beyond this.
Q: Finally critics seem to think that people who hold this position must be automatically and inevitably elitist. Implying that your views mean that ""the masses have been so manipulated that they have neither the perspective or intellect to see beyond the propaganda and require superior intellects like Chomsky's to point out to them the real truth."" How would you respond to such a charge?
NC: Since I've consistently and extensively written precisely the opposite, and detailed the reasons and the record at length, the charge can only come from someone so irrational and blinded by ideological fanaticism that they cannot read simple sentences.

Although everything in that paragraph is backed by published sources, it is written as though the position of the plaintiffs in the Massachusetts lawsuit is the only one that is morally defensible.  Furthermore, the sentence mentioning that Wal-Mart still maintains its conscientious objection policy is written in a tone that seems to suggest that the conscientious objection policy has little or no support from outside of Wal-Mart management (when in fact the contrary is true), or that this policy is socially irresponsible (without due weight to opposing or alternative viewpoints).

Does that explain all of antisemitism? Is is possible that certain other dimensions are relevant? Again, too broad a topic to be stated so definitively.

Congratulations on successfully working through all that you have to get a successful FA (which I assume will happen at this point). I am going to make a couple of comments here so as not to further complicate an already complicated FAC page.
 When you say ""According to one interpretation, Putnam's argument only shows that, although one is unable to be a brain in a vat, one is still able to be a ""brain in a vat"""" - the quotation marks around ""brain in a vat"" are obviously very important. If the quotation marks are intended to mean that the phrase should be taken as a whole, one concept... have you considered using ""brain-in-a-vat""?

 Firstly this article is not a random list of unconnected people who happened to be left-handed.  This article has been down this route before and all it results in is uncited listcruft that attracts more cruft.  The previous section of ""famous left handed people"" was removed from this article and later deleted because of it being non-notable trivia.   Unless the fact these people were famous or notable ''because'' of their left-handedness there is little point to the list.
 The major source of your famous people appears to be a student's webpage.  This is not a reputable source for this information and is clearly incorrect in significant places.  Please link for me a single photograph that demonstrates Einstein left-handedness.  I think you will find all show Einstein favouring his right.  Picasso was also not left-handed, though it is an often repeated myth.
 ""left-handed people tend to be heavily over-represented in history"" - where does this statement of fact come from?  I would be interested to hear how it was determined.
 ""87 percent of the adult population is right-handed"" - Why did you replace cited figures with this uncited statement?  It contradicts the figures given in the very next paragraph.
 ""left-handed people tend to be overrepresented among the most intelligent and successful"" - where is this statement supported?  Again, how was it determined?

I've been in contact with Mr. Trahan over IRC, and while I certainly don't condone his legal threats and sockpuppetry (though, remember that he is a newbie, and don't be a DOLT), he's claiming significant negative effects on his personal life. As you see in the final few seconds of this video, he appears to have a legitimate challenge to the idea that he created the website (I mean, imagine if the MediaWiki developers were blamed for every inaccuracy that falls through the cracks here), which, coupled with the BLP issues, is more than enough to warrant removal of his name from this article until this dispute can be settled.

But when we have a legitimate dispute between sources, with real-world harms on one side, BLP is fairly clear that we should default to the position that protects the living person.

"Egil: There is already a section on history, and much of the content here seems to be not so relevant. More importantly, much of it seems to be original research by the author. The ""Greek Milos"" for instance, exists only in Wikipedia. Not good at all. Im fact, I really have not found any documentation of any of these claims.  

The Greeks derived their systemized standards of measure from a variety of sources including ancient Europe, Mesopotamia, Persia, Phoenicia and Egypt.
The credit for the first systemized collection and standardization probably goes to the empire builders of Mesopotamia and Egypt but the international commerce of the people who benefited by those great empires, the Greeks and Persians and the Romans who followed them is what really required the system be standardized over such vast areas.
The Mesopotamians measured their arable land in garden plots or sar and combined them into fields or ''iku'' of 100 cubits to a side. The Egyptians measured out the irrigation ditches that bounded their ''3ht'' or fields as strips a cubit wide and 100 cubits long known as ''kht''. Their ''st3t'' which was a field 100 cubits to a side became the Greek Aroura.
It is probable that farmers measured out the land their community allowed them to plow in return for digging the ditch by pacing it off and built up an enclosure for it with the stones they found in their furrows.
The community would give the fields out in pairs, one to be plowed and one to remain fallow which were planted in rotation. As beasts of burden were domesticated and yoked to the plow the amount of land under cultivation increased, and a third field was added to be planted in hay or fodder for the plow animal. The side of this cluster of fields became standardized at 350 cubits or one minute of march.
The Milos was based on a stadion equivalent to the Egyptian minute of march.
In Egypt the minute of march was 350 royal cubits long and an hour of march or ''itrw'' was 21,000 royal cubits long. The Greeks tell us they noted their measures of 6 plethrons and 8 stadions, were both the equivalent of the Apothem or slant side of the Great Pyramid.
Using unit measures like the Stadion, Stadium and Furlong which were originally used to lay out fields and only gradually became defined as areas like the Aroura or thousand square royal cubits, the empire builders measured out their roads.
The Greek Milos was originally 8 stadions or 600 Greek pous × 8 = 4800 pous. The Pous came in long, short, and median variations so depending on which one you used the number of pous would vary even as the length of the stadion and Milos remained the same. 600 Attic pous were equal to 625 Ionian pous but both stadions were 185 meters long.
The Romans standard ''pes'' was the Ionian pous of 296 mm so they made their stadium of 185 meters equal to 625 pes or 1000 passus and that made their Milliare 5000 pes.
What makes that a great system for empire builders is that the passus is now a measure of the pace at which the army moves. If such standards of measure are well suited to controlling the movements of armies with milestones related to how much distance can be covered in a set period of time they are equally servicable to the needs of commerce.
Just as the farmer can use the stone walls that border his field to help him restablish its boundaries after a flood, the community can establish its bounds in terms of how much land it needs to irrigate to sustain its population and the ''lugal'' or ''narmr'' (chief farmer) can determine how many men he needs to dig the irrigation system and how much land to alot to each ''oinkos'', ''gene'' and ''phratre'' in return for their service. It's all very feudal.
The city state is based on a market or agora that serves a number of communities which are spaced about as far apart as a man can walk in a day driving a team of oxen pulling a cart.

"86.10.231.219:  Thimerosal - Deletion of Entire section from Thimerosal 
86.10.231.219: '''Clear evidence of an agenda.'''  Editor  deleted an entire section [] from Thimerosal and substituted it on this page.
What a curious description of '''moving''' the section..  And curious of course means POV.
The Thiomersal article was left quite a nice article about a chemical, with a link to the material here - which has a body of agrement on teh talk page there - where I suggested the move.  Nothing is lost, and this arrangement is at least as good as at least two others.  I think the material beliongs together, and I think teh good faith of this anonymous editor User:86.10.231.219 is not something one should assume, in this topic.  
The section about the thimerosal debate has nothing to do with anti-vaccinationists.  The thimerosal issue is about banning the use of a neurotoxin (mercury in the form of thimerosal) in vaccines.  It is not about banning the use of the vaccines nor is it a crusade of principle but about preventing harm to infants by eliminating the neurotoxin and not about eliminating the vaccines.
There is a substnatial overlap in people and in arguments.  That is a large connection.  Lets see what other people think.  Persuading Leiffen (who has a reputation for acting abruptly when some people might look to see what had been discussed and assess whether other people's opinions might have validity to revert it was not actually an action I would suggest indicates you respect him.

Again... that source was on even be4 i got to wikipedia, but nvm that... , it would be a good idea to put that source in.. or as for that.. we can put a source of up to 1 million people of Serbian origin in the U.S. as a higher estimation i wouldnt have anything against, just make it reliable. Largest Serbian diaspora lives in Usa and Germany, this is why we need a higher estimation for the U.S. where undoubtebly live atleast up to 1 million ppl of Serbian origin. Let me give you an example and comparison with Norwegians.... at the end of 19th century there was about 17,000 Norwegians living in the U.S. and about 20,000 Montenegrin Serbs alone... Today number of people with Norwegian ancestry is ~5 million! How many ppl of Serbian origin then... I find these sources okay and if neccesary you can input even a figure from Tim Judah`s book.

"Bth: I don't really understand why dark energy is included here.  While it is a very new idea (in its modern, repulsive form), the observational evidence for it is sufficiently compelling that most working cosmologists now accept it as part of the standard model of the universe (the so-called ""Concordance Cosmology"").  I've rewritten the dark energy section (which seemed to be deeply confused between dark energy and dark matter, another now-standard idea) but I'm not sure it should be here at all.   
Ionized: I don't know why it is here either.  But I didn't want to remove it myself as I had already revamped the rest of the article, and just kind of stopped.  It seems to me that the whole 'dark' scenario has indeed been taken up by the standard, and is not a key ingredient in the usual non-standard models, hence should be removed from the non-standard page.  Now that you have re-written the section, it seems better, but it should still be clarified as to why it is included in the article.  If by chance it was somehow there to lend discredit to the standard, it should be removed. -",True
"LuckyS: The fact that Salman Khan endorses a few products, does not advertise the manufacturer extensively, it's only a mere mention of the name of the products for news value.
 Actors are endorsing products right and left, and advertisers are using that as a hook to get their products into Wikipedia. We delete advertising wherever we see it. Otherwise this encyclopedia would be overrun with advertising. I spend half my time removing linkspam. There is NO NEWS VALUE in product endorsements. Actors shill, they get paid. This is not newsworthy. 
Your suggestions for Headlines were incorporated.

 You know that your use of caps is ungrammatical and highly idiosyncratic? 
Zora:  Bollywood IS the Western identity. Too much so  the other regional industries are often ignored. I suppose I'm as guilty as most, as I know little of Indian films outside Mumbai. ",True
"ClimateOracle:  Changes to the lead. 
ClimateOracle: I have updated the lead to reflect the fact that he has announced his departure from ""the climate profession in general.""  I have also added to his list of notable accomplishments the fact that he is best known in the media as a Wikipedia contributor for his work on the climate change and global warming articles, and that he is a retired climate professional as this is likely his next most notable attribute in the media.

"Number 57:  Could I ask why you reverted my changes and move of this article. You have simply stated external_link. However, it is correct according to the external_link, which is very highly regarded. Cheers, Also, I am not sure why you are labelling it an ""out of process move"". It is a completely within process move.
DrKay:  You are being disruptive. If you want to move the page, follow the correct process, which for contested or controversial moves is a requested move, and don't edit war.",True
