There were plenty of steaks to go around the whole family.
I hope everyone gets to meet up with their family at some point because in the end it's all that you have and you don't want to waste that.
Absolutely not.
it was an nice experience i had ever.
we are childhood friends.
I haden't a clue what the problem could be.
I would be all alone.
"Due to stage 4 cancer, I'd lost her just 6 months prior."
Was this her way of giving me the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.
The grandmother to my children was no more.
I think I may try using acrylics next time I am in front of the canvas.
It took a couple hours but it looked great.
The sun was starting to come up and it was going to be a very hot day but the fun of painting in the street helped to make you forget all of that.
Especially when it was for something so dumb like not cleaning my room.
Sometimes I just hate her.
"Just say, oops I made a big mistake and it wont happen again."
When I was finally ready to give her a chance that went all the way left.
I remember I asked her one year about my childhood and she said God has already forgiven me for the things that have happened to you.
That's how I found myself homeless.
"My eyes now  follow their peaceful smiles, their kids full of crisp laughter as they casually walk about the grounds."
That's very different than being me who is now a drifter who never dreams anymore.
I hold onto my faith fiercely hoping a miracle might come along.
Of course I realized this too late.
There is a scene in the movie 'Office Space' that really strikes home.
I feel him.
"A few classics, a few books for guilty pleasures."
Get healthy and have more energy for my kids when I get home.
"Leaving the world a better place, making connections with those around me, doing good when no one is looking."
"This is never really a promise, but a reminder that life is short, the world is small, and if I do not put time aside to see new places 'that day' will never come."
"So, October, I guess I am glad to see you."
You are my first step in winter to a new year.
It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads.
Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together.
"We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense."
We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other.
"This only happened a month ago, but we still have yet to inform some of our good friends."
But sometimes that can be inevitable with a big group of friends like we have.
I know right now that Megan and I seem like a perfect match.
"Hopefully we will last and can continue to have fun together, regardless of what our friends say."
"It was worth the risk, we both agreed."
"I must admit, the 'wrong' nature of what we did sort of made it more appealing."
I think she would agree with that.
I am a recovering alcoholic and she is a recovering codependent.
"We are very happy, and, to be honest, we are one of the healthiest couples I know."
"I have high hopes for us, and she does, too."
I hope his life will have meaning.
I was not too far away.
"But what really matters on this special day is not only proving to myself I could do it, but showing my Daughter to never give up."
"The told me continuously to start classes, to get moving on it, at times there were almost relentless about it."
"They never let me forget that promise, my mother reminded me of it daily, my father talked about it often and I carried that around with me until this day."
"The sun was shining, it was warm and there wasn't a cloud in the sky."
I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal.
This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier.
Would it change my life?
Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful?
It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it.
Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here?
"What made this even more special is that I would receive my Degree alongside of my Daughter who on the exact day, was receiving her Masters degree in Chemical Engineering."
I don't know what caused the sudden surge of emotions but part of me felt my parents right there on the stage with me.
I was so proud of my daughter and I knew that 2 other people were looking down on me with the same pride.
"But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman."
Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out.
"Thankfully, one of the girl's mom was a dry cleaner and immediately took the dress to get the stain out."
"There was a lot of people in a tight space, so, I bumped into someone and spilled champagne entirely down my blush gown!"
The wedding went on without a hitch.
3 week ago my dog passed away and I was not there to see her go.
Thank you Shelly.
"Three weeks ago, my dog died."
"As it turned out, I would not have made it."
I was profoundly crushed.
"The pay was okay, but it was more about finally being able to do what I love, what I spent so long trying to achieve."
Even if I end up having to get a part-time job on top of this to make ends meet.
"I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up."
Turns out from what he told me later they both apologized to each other and decided life was too short to continue arguing.
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
My heart is utterly broken.
It was sudden and very tragic.
"I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February."
I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are.
"This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives."
We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.
She was having a normal day on the day she passed away.
She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.
I miss her smile and I miss her laugh.
Growing up we had a rocky relationship.
We never really got along and argued a lot.
The memorable event that I shared was when my step-father got in touch with me after a long time of us not speaking to each other.
My biological dad left when I was a baby so my step-dad was pretty much the sole father figure in my life during some of my formative years (around age four to nine).
So my step-dad apparently got my phone number from my mom and gave me an unexpected call one day several months ago.
My dad passed away last month.
He used to work in Detroit.
Ni biggie.
Yesterday a huge check showed up from dad. Huge.
She was my best friend.
I was ecstatic and very surprised when I received the 12 checks in the mail from the lawyer.
It was the case in which I received the 12 checks from.
There were a list of payments that were to be made to my father and now to me.
"I can't believe that in all my years of going to college in Utah, I had never made it to Zion."
"Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long."
"I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then."
All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.
So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.
I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.
"Even though I'm feeling defeated, I'm also feeling oddly hopeful too."
"But it didn't cure my frequent urination, which is what i'm going through right now."
What a wild ride this life has been so far.
"The ups, the downs and everything in between."
I was logical.
It took a very long time to realize who she really was and what her intentions were.
"I still remember the time when it dawned on me, all that she had done to me."
I remember it all sinking in.
I was disappointed.
"Again, I don't even know if me cutting her out of my life was what caused her life to unravel."
"I continue to pray for healing and restoration, but I'm losing hope."
I think about when the tragedy that struck our family just over 2 years ago and never thought it would result in our family separating.
So then what happens to the family?
"Our next and last trip was in Chattanooga Tennessee, where we stumbled upon two other theme parks."
I think our last theme park was the best one.
"After it was all said and done, we were very happy with our decisions and had a fantastic time."
We spent three days.
I had never seen it from the Canadian side.
"Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm."
The most memorable part of the Honeymoon was probably the first park.
"Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now."
Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.
She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.
The kids were killed in that horrible accident.
My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.
"She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy."
I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it.
I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit.
"Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom."
For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling.
I always feel like I am not in the moment.
It's like a lightbulb went off and I realized what all I'm missing out on.
"Now, that I finally see what I've been doing I know what I have to change."
I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game.
I actually quite like his company and we enjoy our in-game banter and he actually jokes a lot with me now.
"However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy."
"He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it."
"Now, Sam is a bit on the husky side, but that is truly his only downfall."
"When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk."
He handled it like a champ - and since then - there have been no squabbles on that field!
He was so very liked by many people.
His down to earth and jovial personality will certainly be missed.
This took some of us by surprise.
We wanted to show a formal amount of respect.
But I guess this is the way he wanted it.
I think they felt uncomfortably overdressed.
I for one will remember all the good times I had with John.
"The following week at work, a number of us talked about Johns service."
Our management decided to have one day a month where we could wear our sports jerseys.
He was only 30 years old.
His funeral was just two weekends ago and many came to support his wife and children as they move on with life.
He worked for several years in multiple departments.
His smile and friendly disposition was well known and an great encouragement to many.
He leaves behind a young wife of whom I worked with in a different department.
She was also very well liked.
He also leaves behind a teenage son and daughter who must now face life without their dad.
Just a year prior he was healthy and working with a bright future.
"His favorite sports team was the Tampa Bay Buc's and it was suggested, not required, that those who wanted to could wear their jerseys to the memorial service."
They all mingled together talking about the shortness of his life and shock of being loss so young.
We meet many we hadn't seen in sometime and all we happy to see us though not under the circumstances we came for.
Unexpected bumps in the road that you have to deal with and move on.
You never know when life will throw one of those bumps in your path.
She said that had found someone else and was no longer in love with me.
Did I see it coming?
"Should I have seen it coming, yup!"
So what to do?
So I didn't have to see it.
Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world.
"I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters."
There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.
"Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book."
As such the others paled in comparison.
It was titled 'Lonesome Dove' and was written by Larry McMurtry.
'Lonesome Dove' is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.
The scenery and imagery are very rich.
You need to remember this book and maybe get other books written by McMurtry.
"Nine months ago, I had a little panic."
His number was not reachable.
"because that was my only option ., As i intend to look my best on this day."
I can never forget this day.
As if that was not enough.
One of us started misbehaving and convulsing.
My eyes look normal for the first time in my life.
I can't wait to go to my 10 year high school reunion and see everyone's faces!
Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed.
This is no longer a problem!
It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!
She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them.
"Four months ago, I had to say goodbye to three friends in my life."
In late May I lost my dog.
The morning it happened I woke up and she had thrown up on the bed.
"Blissfully unaware, I enjoyed the prospect of having a new infant in the family to love and spoil as only a grandmother can."
"Although it has been so difficult, my sole focus is on this beautiful child and making sure she has the love, care, and attention that all innocent children deserve."
"Now, they are involved with this baby."
We have to sign papers that we will watch the child and not allow her mother around her unsupervised.
It's hard having them all in the home.
I have been trying to help all of them.
I hope every day that she has a bright and safe future.
"Then, 6 months ago, I had a miscarriage."
"I didn't think that this would actually happen to me, but it did."
You never think this kind of thing would happen to you until it did.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I don't want to go to school.
Feels like just yesterday when I was told I was pregnant.
"From the time I found out to this miscarriage, it was only what?"
It feels like I just blinked and the entire event flew by.
"I can't believe, again, that this would happen to me."
It happened on February 12th 2019.
Well...used to be.
I felt and saw it - it was kinda like something big going through me and then it was all over me.
"I was able to pick it up, move it, etc."
It's crazy to think about even now.
So I let him hold him but then he dropped him.
This is going to be his home for years to come.
Or drugs?
But really.
He would shuffle around and try to dig his way into the paper towels I laid down for the trip whenever the box was closed.
I've always loved taking picture.
To see MY picture.
My name in the credits of Time freaking magazine!
I had been trying for a little while to get a portrait published and when it finally happened I couldn't have been more excited!
"Before noon, I developed a sudden and a strange severe pain, which i never expected that could happen due to my health condition."
I developed and woke up to an extreme pain.
"This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain."
The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth.
"I do not want to die, but I cannot imagine a life without him."
I dont know how people can just move on like that do they not feel as deeply as they show.
I want to be proud of myself and make the ones who came before me proud.
"Although, There are a number of critical breakthroughs that your infant will reach early in life."
I look forward to seeing him start to walk on his own.
"I bet his girlfriend convinced him, he's just a really passive guy."
I was probably more excited than him about organizing all of this--I'm a bit of a control freak.
I was not ready to handle this level of stress.
Just when things seems to be going right for once in my life.
Here this comes.
THe hope that she would live was bad enough.
Hard to breathe right now.
He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life.
One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke.
She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really.
"We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke."
Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her.
"We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc."
"It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away."
Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources.
There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section.
"It could be because I'm not home too, change is always hard for a toddler."
"The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again."
"With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery."
This time was different.
He was barely two.
I didn't know if he was going to be upset.
Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day.
"I asked my mom what happened, where is grandpa?"
Is he okay?
The worst day of my life is when I lost one of my best friends my grandpa.
Majestic was the only way to describe the land in this area.
"Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting."
I think a support system is very important.
i am so very proud of him.
"This, also, was a fun time."
It is very hard for a mom to leave her son behind to be on his own.
I was not aware that i needed to pay taxes on Patreon income.
"It made sense after the fact, since it is income."
I should have known.
I four years to go back over.
Overall it wasn't that big of a deal too.
The installments made it easy in a way.
I just felt it was different in some way.
"This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief."
And eventually I quit my wage job and it became my main source of income.
And my monthly income was within the personal exemption amount.
So my worst fears weren't realized.
There was a time in my life when I didn't think I would ever want to have kids.
"But the more I think about it, the more I realize that this might be a gift."
"And now, all of a sudden, it's like time has just opened up before me."
A little over 3 months ago I discovered that I was unexpectedly pregnant.
Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant.
It's amazing how everything just works out as it's supposed to.
It was a normal day in Portland Oregon.
I was in the bathroom and some dude was shooting up in the stall.
I do not support drug use around the city and in public or really anywhere.
I think that will probably be our last family reunion .
It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long.
It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.
At least for me anyway.
I probably should give myself more credit for actually pulling such a change off too.
"Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I."
Her name was Debbie.
"So, I visited this woman I had not seen in 48 years in April of this year."
Talk about being floored!
Not so much the formal aspects.
It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles.
Overall one of the best weddings I have every attended.
It was a simple affair in the backyard of a friend's house.
Also in attendance were her girlfriend's family and friends.
It really felt like it came from a professional.
I really have to say it intrigued me too.
"Now that I know more about that, and how it can bring people together, I am really intrigued by it."
"Its something that is a process, but at the same time it is also peaceful."
The event was way more than I expected.
We had over 100 people show up.
"They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them."
It was encouraging to see.
It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store.
"I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today."
Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids.
He was so proud.
It's moments like that that touch me the most.
How easy it is to make a child feel special and proud of themselves.
First my mom fell and was hospitalized.
I really should know better.
I am really glad they are all able to lean on each other.
"It happened so quickly, that I had no chance to help her or slow her fall."
It was a disaster.
"They totally screwed up the menu, it was like they got another wedding order mixed up with my cousins."
"Her husband's father owns a farm up in the country, and that's where they had the wedding."
"They were having issues with the food too, as there wasn't enough of it and they had to order pizza."
I don't get out to the country often.
"Since there were no trees around, it was nice and quiet and quite beautiful."
"It was very hot, and the reception being held in a nearby metal barn didn't help either."
"In an odd turn of events, I never actually got to speak to her husband, even though we were in a picture together."
I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.
He/She darted in and out of the stream of water.
"It was no afraid of me, it liked the water."
Or maybe we should plan a trip for Dec. when the new baby is born.
"Once my sister (C) arrived we started to have lunch, but not before N took her mother's sandwich and hid it."
She made C find it in the oven which was her way of telling her mom and dad that a new grandchild was on the way.
They were restructuring and he was being laid off.
On Sat.
I've been so busy since then that I'm just now writing about it.
I'm such a procrastinator!
"I had totally forgotten about it because I never win anything, even though I check the page daily for new contests."
I almost thought it wasn't real.
"She got real quiet and said she needed to check something, so she put me on hold."
"When she came back on the line it was with the most awesome, unexpected news!"
He told me that his mom heard my name on the radio and that I won a trip to Las Vegas.
I was extremely excited as I won a trip and was seeing my favorite singer all in the same day.
"That was easy, my girlfriend."
We hadn't been dating that long but I knew she was the perfect choice.
Then it happened.
It was a friend of mine saying that they heard my name on the radio and I had 15 mins to call to claim my prize.
They say i did not win?
It was a 4 day 3 night free trip with airfare to Las Vegas.
Both me and my spouse love Vegas.
I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat.
I am very glad to have stumbled upon this field of knowledge.
It was a fun experience.
It was a big adventure.
"July 14, 2019On the morning of July 14th myself, my husband, my brother, my niece and my sister and her husband all decided to hike to the top of Mt."
I would love to try again in the future and see if we can make it to the top faster the next time.
Leconte via Alum Trail.
Fast foward two years later.
My hiking companions this time are the same minus my daughter.
It really was great!
About three months ago I went on a family vacation.
There were a lot of downsides to the cruise.
contributed to a somewhat negative experience.
"However, I do not have a desire to go on the particular cruise or cruise line again."
He was a vision compared to his other classmates.
This is what we had all been waiting for all these years.
He was graduating from college and it was a very special trip for me.
"At the very end of the night, the most wonderful thing happened."
"Every time I think of that night and the pride and happiness for him that I have, the look in his eyes at that moment is the first thing that pops into my head."
I am usually not that great at taking everything in and focus on small details in my life and at events as opposed to the big picture.
"In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night."
I will never forget the look he had on his face.
And it became quickly obvious that it came from the sky.
"Six jets, clearly war planes of some kind, flew over us, almost as fast as arrows."
Why would they fly like that over a peaceful city like ours?
"In that instant, I didn't feel scared for myself or my community, but I felt horrified by the sheer amount of brute force and power displayed."
it feel little bit cool as summer almost over.
"Suddenly, there is big noise from the sky."
I wonder if it is preparing an event for Labor day.
I could have a chance to take a picture.
"however, it didn't happen."
"Sometime, you can't expecting a thing happen twice if you don't know what it from."
their are flying in V form above the river .
This was a surprising event happen in a normal day.
"I know they’re usually grateful when we drop off food, especially around the holidays, but this little extra something special really drove it home for them; people truly do care about each other."
And they say teenagers only care about themselves… She’s a good egg.
I was too drunk to sing.
I had to sit down for the rest of the day.
"Naturally, this ran on a different schedule."
"First, we planned on taking a bus that we did not realize does not run frequently on the weekend."
We missed that bus by a few minutes.
"It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July."
It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early.
"I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager."
I was actually promoted earlier than I was supposed to be.
"I was supposed to be promoted in September of 2019, but instead, I was promoted starting in July of 2019."
It was a normal day when it first happened.
"She told me that she put in for early promotion for me, and it was approved instantly."
"I also love that I was able to get promoted so early, and I also heard that nobody in a long time has been promoted early like I have."
Even people I don't really talk to that much.
It was during my last trip to the store that night.
"Yet, there she was, saying my name in the gentle yet comforting way she always did and smiling at me like I was something to be proud of."
If it wasn't for her I'd have to stay home to help my wife with daily activities.
Only recently have things approximated the old days.
It was a long and gruelly process but sometimes the things that take the longest to transpire are worth the wait.
"He and I went to High School together, when we met again he told me about a house that was up for sale after meeting him again in a grocery store."
About three months ago something amazing happened to me.
It was everything I wanted and dreamed of when I first started the process of buying a home.
It was perfect for me.
There were a few things that needed to be done and a few things that needed updating but the house was exactly what I was looking for.
This was five months ago and wow!
I should be able to move from my apartment into a house within the next two years.
I'm glad I took the promotion even though it required that I move.
It was intimidating to be chosen for this opportunity but I felt ready.
I looked at the process as a challenge but also a reward for my hard work.
"I am currently still in the position and live in the new city, which means I think about it all the time."
My life back home was easier.
It was easier to do the same thing again and again.
It was easier to have the same places to go and not be too concerned about what to do next.
My best friend gave a funny speech and everyone laughed their hearts out.
I was greatly overwhelmed by how awesome he has been in our first ten years together.
"Our love, bond, and loyalty has only grown with every year of new adventures and exciting times."
What a place this turned out to be.
"I think the reason we all enjoyed it so much is because it was something that my parents, myself, and my young children all could enjoy together."
"The vast rock formations, and huge canyon was amazing."
"She has a little dog named Bailey, and he doesn't really like new people."
He probably enjoyed meeting Bailey more than he did my friend!
I can see the three of us having a very close friendship together!
"Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much."
"Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house."
"Life just gets in the way sometimes, especially as an adult."
Everytime we get together laughs are guaranteed.
"My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament."
I remember it was like the 3rd or 4th game when something bad happened.
All in all right now this wasn't looking like the best idea.
"Not only did we happen to attend the same church, we also share the same birth month."
We share so much in common.
We had planned to attend the same college and even study the same course.
I didn't realize how fancy or big the party was going to be.
"Clearly, it was a really big deal."
I was really happy I could be there for my friend.
I thought it was going to be family only but then I heard my name.
"She seemed an ordinary older woman, no different than an average elderly person."
It’s truly an experience we will never forget.
When booking with JSG each of these elements has always been met & often exceeded.
It was incredible to walk in our room & feel so special.
I would highly recommend putting your trust in the JSG team to plan your next vacation!
My husband got a huge bonus sent to him in the mail as a check.
In my situation it was well worth it.
It was his boss.
"We were only going to spend two days there, though I wished it could have been longer."
Your boss or someone else is supposed to help you but I was on my own.
That took a couple days.
I thought I would be there for 2 hours.
In the end I would say it was worth it.
"A friend had suggested I go to Alaska, it was far away and desolate, it sounded perfect."
"While i was watching the moose i heard a scream not too far off which sounded like a cat, and indeed it was."
"Next, I heard a strange sound I hadn’t heard before."
"As I looked out I saw something trotting through the woods, not far from the moose."
To my surprise it was a lynx.
Lynx are a pretty rare sight as they are very sneaky.
"I noticed another lynx not far behind the first one, it was an amazing sight."
The sauces were the best part.
The desserts were even better.
It was a great night.
Dear Diary.
The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house.
I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting.
But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them.
The best one would be selected to be implemented by the boss.
I was so excited when I found out that mine had won!
i made high potential and efficiency obtained that was quiet surprising.
the promotion were general designer.
I believed in myself.
"this is where the core of my problem lies, A fear of public speaking is often  related with social anxiety and being afraid what others think, dislike being the center of attention being judged etc."
I used to be petrified of speaking in public.
A lack of structure often causes a speaker to get  nervous and perform poorly.
you hardly ever forget what you want to say and You give he audience a great way to stay engaged the entire time.
I have two young children and a wonderful life.
This was an unexpected life event for me!
"Like i said in my statement before, i found out i had prostate cancer in March 2019."
I got him some bugs  for a gift .
they were real bugs encased in acrylic.
A great light outdoor shirt.
