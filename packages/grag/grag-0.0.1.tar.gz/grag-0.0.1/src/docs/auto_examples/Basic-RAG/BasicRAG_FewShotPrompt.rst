Custom Few-Shot Prompts
============================
This cookbook demonstrates how to use custom few-shot prompts with Basic RAG.

`Note that this cookbook assumes that you already have the` ``Llama-2-13b-chat`` `LLM ready, `
`for more details on how to quantize and run an LLM locally, `
`refer to the LLM section under Getting Started.`

`Note that this cookbook also assumes that you have already ingested documents into a DeepLake collection called 'grag'`
`for more details on how to ingest documents refer to the cookbook called` ``Document Ingestion``.
