*******************************
The parameter 'energy_storage_duration' is not included in your settings file. This parameter converts MW to energy capacity (MWh) for existing generators where data is otherwise not available. For example, EIA-860m generally does not have MWh for battery storage units installed in the current calendar year. The energy capacity of existing storage clusters may be incorrect if you do not include this parameter!
