# SimNexus: Business Simulation Toolkit

This Python package provides a set of classes for simulating various
business-related scenarios. It is designed for educational use, allowing
students to experiment with modeling, analysis, and decision-making in different
contexts.

## Installation

To install SimNexus

```bash
pip install simnexus
```

## Available Simulations

- **Stock Market Simulation:** Simulate stock price fluctuations, incorporate
  technical indicators, and develop simple trading strategies.
- **Resource Fluctuations Simulation:** Model changes in the price of a
  resource, analyze supply/demand dynamics, and implement hedging strategies.
- **Product Popularity Simulation:** Simulate the rise and fall of product
  demand, investigate virality factors, and examine different marketing
  strategies.

## Documentation

For more detailed information about using SimNexus, see the [documentation](https://yourproject.readthedocs.io/).


## Basic Usage Example

Here is an example of how to use the Resource Fluctuations Simulation:

```python
from simnexus import ResourceFluctuationsSimulation

# Create a resource simulation
sim = ResourceFluctuationsSimulation(start_price=100, days=365, volatility=0.05, drift=0.01,
                         supply_disruption_day=180, disruption_severity=0.2)

# Run the simulation and get results
prices = sim.run_simulation()

# Visualize or analyze the results here
```

## Project Goals (For Students)

- Gain familiarity with using simulations to model dynamic systems.
- Understand the impact of different parameters on simulation outcomes.
- Develop data analysis and visualization skills in the context of business problems.
- Practice translating business concepts into simulation parameters.
