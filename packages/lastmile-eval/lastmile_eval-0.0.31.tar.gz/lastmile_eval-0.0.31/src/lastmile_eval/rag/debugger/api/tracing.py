    A tracer proxy around OpenTelemetry tracer. It has 3 main functionalities:

            a. `start_as_current_span()`
            b. `start_span()`
    2. Mark RAG events and store their states (see `RAGQueryEvent` and
        `RAGIngestionEvent`) alongside the trace data. The methods for this are:
            a. `mark_rag_ingestion_trace_event`
            b. `mark_rag_query_trace_event`
    3. Register a dictionary of parameters to be logged and associated with
        the trace data. The methods for this are:
            a. `register_param()`
            b. `get_params()`
