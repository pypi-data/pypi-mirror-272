# Django Allauth Themes

Themes for django-allauth

## Install

```shell
pip install django-allauth-themes
```

### Settings

Add `allauth_themes.bootstrap` before `allauth`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "allauth_themes.bootstrap",
    "allauth",
    ...,
]
```

## Customization

### Bootswatch

You can achieve drastic changes with little effort using Bootswatch themes. Simply create a file in your templates directory to override the `allauth/layouts/css.html` file, with the following CDN link

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootswatch@5.3.3/dist/cerulean/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

You can change `cerulean` to any of the available themes available on [Bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/).

### Custom CSS

Alternatively, you can customize Bootstrap as you like and use that:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/custom_bootstrap.css' %}">
```

### Layout Customization

These minor tweaks to the layouts may help the content stand out more. However, it doesn't work well with all Bootswatch themes (like quartz and vapor), so it's not included in the default layouts:

```html
  <div class="d-flex h-100 bg-body-secondary">
    <div class="m-auto p-4 border rounded-3 shadow-lg bg-white">
      {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </div>
  </div>
```
