> A small Python library to test binary sequences with Golomb's randomness postulates.

## Installation

Python >=3.10 is required.

```
pip install pygolomb
```

## Developing

Create venv and install dependencies.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

## Testing

```
. .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

To check test coverage:

```
pytest --cov=pygolomb tests/
```

## Roadmap

The overall code quality is largely at the same level it was back in 2018. This is to be improved in the future.

## GUI application

There are no plans to have a new GUI at the moment. The old Tkinter application remains in `gui` directory only for historic purposes.
