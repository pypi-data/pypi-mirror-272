# MultiTypeArray

MultiTypeArray is a Python library that provides a custom array data structure capable of storing elements of different data types. Unlike Python's built-in list, which can store elements of different types, MultiTypeArray offers additional methods and functionality specific to multi-type arrays.

## Features

- Store elements of different data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.) in the same array.
- Append, insert, remove, and pop elements from the array.
- Access elements using indexing and slicing.
- Iterate over the array.
- Extend the array with elements from an iterable.
- Find the index of an element in the array.
- Count the occurrences of an element in the array.
- Reverse the order of elements in the array.
- Sort the array using a custom key function and order (ascending or descending).

## Installation

You can install MultiTypeArray using pip:

```
pip install multitypearray
```
