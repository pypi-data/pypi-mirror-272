if this doesn't work make sure that the templates setting has 'DIRS': ['templates'], in it::

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            ...
            'DIRS': ['templates'],

## django-tinymce
If you want to use rich text answers you will need to [install django-tinymce](https://django-tinymce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#id2)

Make sure to include in the template the `{{ form.media }}` to include the tinymce javascript and css files.
> [!WARNING]  
> Failing to follow the following steps will result in a xss vulnerability in your site.

To allow the rich text answers to be rendered properly you will need to use the safe filter in your templates.
While django-tinymce does escape the html the answers that were created when the rich text editor was not enabled **has not been escaped and is not safe**.
So these answers cannot be rendered with the safe filter. So a flag was added to the answer model 'is_rich_text' that is set to True when the answer is created with the rich text editor.
In the template you can use the following code to render the answer properly::

    {% if answer.is_rich_text %}
        {{answer.answer|safe}}
    {% else %}
        {{answer.answer}}
    {% endif %}
