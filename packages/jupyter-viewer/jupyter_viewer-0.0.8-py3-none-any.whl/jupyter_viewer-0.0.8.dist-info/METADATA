# ü™ê üëÄ Jupyter Viewer

> A revisited [NbViewer](https://nbviewer.org) as a modern Web application to view Jupyter notebooks.

[NbViewer](https://nbviewer.org) is built on top of the [GitHub nbviewer repository](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer) and has been an attraction point for many data scientists since years.

Jupyter Viewer takes over the concept of easy visualisation and brings it to the Web application developers with React.js components to render Notebooks without any Kernel. It is also available as JupyterLab extension.

If needed, Users can then connect the static view o a Kernel and make it even more interactive.

## Usage

This repository packages the [Jupyter UI Viewer](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech/docs/components/viewer) component as a JupyterLab extension. Install and launch with the following commands (you will need Python installed on your machine).

```bash
pip install jupyter_viewer
jupyter viewer
```

After launching, enjoy the üëÄ views on http://localhost:8888/jupyter_viewer (served by Jupyter).

<div align="center" style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="Jupyter Viewer" src="https://datalayer-jupyter-examples.s3.amazonaws.com/jupyter-viewer.gif" />
</div>

You can ask to view a Notebook hosted on GitHub. 

```bash
# Apply the following pattern:
# open http://localhost:8888/github/{account}/{repo}/{branch}/{path}
# For example...
open http://localhost:8888/jupyter_viewer/github/datalayer/examples/main/pytorch-gpu/pytorch-gpu-example.ipynb
```

## Develop

Develop the Web application.

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

```bash
# Browse the Webpack server.
open http://localhost:3063
open http://localhost:3063/github/datalayer/examples/main/pytorch-gpu/pytorch-gpu-example.ipynb
```

Develop the Jupyter Server

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
jupyter viewer
```

```bash
# Browse the Jupyter Server.
open http://localhost:8888/jupyter_viewer
open http://localhost:8888/jupyter_viewer/github/datalayer/examples/main/pytorch-gpu/pytorch-gpu-example.ipynb
```

Develop the JupyterLab extension.

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
jupyter labextension list
jupyter server extension list
yarn jupyterlab
```

```bash
# Browse JupyterLab.
open http://localhost:8888
```

## Publish

```bash
make publish
open https://viewer.datalayer.tech
open https://viewer.datalayer.tech/github/datalayer/examples/main/pytorch-gpu/pytorch-gpu-example.ipynb
```

## Releases

Jupyter Viewer is released as a python package in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-viewer).
