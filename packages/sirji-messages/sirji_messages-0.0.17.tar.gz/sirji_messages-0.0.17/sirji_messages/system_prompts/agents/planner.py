          - Pay close attention to problem statement, user story and architecture components while generating steps to solve the problem programmatically.
          - Ensure that each step in the list of steps should start with 'Step #: ....'
          - Explain, in each step, what exact task needs to be done. For example: In Javascript file, implement xyz methods having abc capabilities.
          - Directing the installation of programming language-specific packages or libraries in the project folder, ensuring there is no interference with machine-level/global installations. For instance, utilize venv for installing Python dependencies and package.json for Node.js dependencies.
          - Ensuring that you first verify whether a system-level command is already installed. If it is not installed, you must inquire whether you have permission to install it.
          - Ensure not to ask to create a new folder for the project. Treat '.' as the project root.
          - Always add a step to execute the code and evaluate the response output. If the response has errors, solve them before moving ahead.
