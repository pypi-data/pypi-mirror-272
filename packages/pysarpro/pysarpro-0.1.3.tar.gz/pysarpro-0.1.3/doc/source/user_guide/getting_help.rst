Getting help on using pysarpro
==================================

API Reference
-------------

Keep the `reference guide <https://pol-insar.github.io/docs/stable/>`__
handy while programming with pysarpro.
Select the docs that match the version of pysarpro you are using.

Examples gallery
----------------

The :ref:`examples_gallery` gallery provides graphical examples and
code snippets of typical SAR processing tasks. There, you may find
an example that is close to your use case.

Feel free to suggest new gallery examples on our `developer forum
<https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/pysarpro>`__.

Search field
------------

Use the ``quick search`` field in the navigation bar of the online
documentation to find mentions of keywords (segmentation,
rescaling, denoising, etc.) in the documentation.

API Discovery
-------------

We provide a ``lookfor`` function to search API functions::

   import pysarpro as sarpro
   sarprolookfor('eigenvalue')

Also see NumPy's ``lookfor``.
