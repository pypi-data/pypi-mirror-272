## Getting started with your project

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:Shlomigreen/dataconf-dbx.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with
