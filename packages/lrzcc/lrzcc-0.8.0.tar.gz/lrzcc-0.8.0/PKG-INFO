# README

Command line tool for LRZ-specific features of the LRZ Compute Cloud
[https://cc.lrz.de](https://cc.lrz.de), first and foremost the budgeting system.

## Installation
Install the tool via pip:
```bash
pip install lrzcc
```

## Usage
As a general note, use the `-h/--help` to find out more about the specific
commands of the tool.

### API Access
As with the normal Openstack CLI client you need to source your Openstack RC
file to access the API. You can download it when clicking on you username
in the top-right corner in the webui and then "OpenStack RC File v3".

Source it via:
```bash
. di12abc-openrc.sh
```
replacing `di12abc` with you own username, and then enter your password.
Note: this stores you credentials in environment variables starting with
`OS_` for OpenStack.

### User Workflows

#### Get Own User
```bash
lrzcc user me
```
Note: role 1 indicates that you are a normal user, role 2 means you are a
master user.

#### List Flavor Prices
```bash
lrzcc flavor-price list
```

#### Calculate Own Consumption and Cost
```bash
lrzcc server-consumption
lrzcc server-cost
```

#### View User and Project Budget
```bash
lrzcc user-budget list
lrzcc project-budget list
```

#### Check of Budget is Over
```bash
lrzcc user-budget over -dc
```

#### Show Budget Over Tree
This hierarchical view also shows a breakdown of the cost down to the
individual servers and is what the webui uses:
```bash
lrzcc -f json budget-over-tree
```
Note: the `-f json` tells the tool to simply output the JSON response from
the API.

### Master User Workflows

#### List Own Project and Users
```bash
lrzcc project list
lrzcc user list -p <project_id/name>
```

#### List Budgets of Own Project
```bash
lrzcc user-budget list -p <project_id/name>
```

#### List Budget Over Status of Project's Users
```bash
lrzcc user-budget over -p <project_id/name> -dc
```

#### Show Budget Over Tree of Project's Users
This hierarchical view also shows a breakdown of the cost down to the
individual users and servers and is what the webui uses:
```bash
lrzcc -f json budget-over-tree -p <project_id/name>
```
Note: the `-f json` tells the tool to simply output the JSON response from
the API.

#### Modify Budgets
```bash
lrzcc user-budget modify <user_budget_id> -a <amount>
lrzcc project-budget modify <project_budget_id> -a <amount>
```
Note: you cannot set a budget below the already acrued costs or modify the
budget of a past year.

## Warning
Don't rely on the fact that this is written in Python at the moment, this is
going to be replaced by a corresponding Rust library + CLI application in
the not so distant future.
