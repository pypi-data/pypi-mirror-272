# Map of Hale-Bopp in 1997 {.example-header}

![map-hale-bopp](/images/examples/map_hale_bopp.png)

Here's an example that uses [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) to get some data on the comet [Hale-Bopp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hale%E2%80%93Bopp) ☄️ and then uses that data to plot the comet's location in the sky in March and April of 1997 (when the comet was at its brightest in the sky):

!!! star "Note"

    Skyfield is a required dependency of Starplot (and a very important one!), so if you have Starplot installed, then Skyfield should be installed too.


```python
