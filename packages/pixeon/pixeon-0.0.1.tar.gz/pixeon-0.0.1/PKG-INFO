# PIXEON: Picture Exploration & Neural Training Module

## A module, you could say, that you can use for determining picture accuracy
## The main.py is what you want, everything else was just my "progress" saves
## See main.py for examples in the `if __name__ == '__main__': blah blah`
## The point of this is to compare images and using the `catagorize` function, you can compare a bulk of images.
## Unfortunately, you must pass a path list of all of the pictures and not the directory that contains the images.
## Make sure that the MLP (Machine learning Picture/Path) is a list if you are wanting to catagorize, and a string if you want to just compare two images
## Not really a consistant project, but rather an idea I slopped together with just enough effort to get the job done

# My Uses:
## The whole reason that I created this in the first place was to make a homemade, inefficient, probably not 100% accurate face recognition system for my socket servers.
