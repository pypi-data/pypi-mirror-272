    - output_path (str or pathlib.Path): output file
    - show_progress (bool): if True, then tqdm progress indicator is displayed
    - cache (str, pathlib.Path or None): FABDEM is stored online in large tiles,
    which need to be downloaded in their entirety. If you are unsure about the
    exact bounds you need it is thus advantageous to cache the downloaded files.
    To do so, pass a folder location as a cache parameter which is where the
    raw files will be stored. By default, None, the files are stored in the OS
    temporary folder and will be available until the temporary folder is
    cleaned - usually on OS restart.
