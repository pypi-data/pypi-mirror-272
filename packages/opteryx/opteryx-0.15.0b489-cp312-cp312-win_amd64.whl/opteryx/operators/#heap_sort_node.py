"""
Heap Sort Node

This is a SQL Query Execution Plan Node.

This node orders a dataset, note that Heap Sort in this instance isn't the heap sort
algorithm, it is an approach where a heap of n items (the limit) is maintained as the
data passes through the operator. Because we are working with chunks, we build a 
temporary batch of n + len(batch) items, sort them and then discard all but n of
the items.

This is faster, particularly when working with large datasets even though we're now
sorting smaller datasets over and over again.

Early testing with a ~10m record dataset:
- sort then limit: 39.2 seconds
- heapsort: 9.8 seconds
